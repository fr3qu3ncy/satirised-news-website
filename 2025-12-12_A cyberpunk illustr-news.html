        <p>BREAKING: Russian Ambassador Summoned for Trying to Crash Air Traffic Control with Bouncy Castle<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the German government has summoned the Russian ambassador over allegations that Russia's military intelligence service GRU was behind a cyber-attack on air traffic control. But wait, it gets better!<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation (okay, I just made this up), the hackers were actually trying to use the air traffic control system to order pizza for the entire country. That's right, Russia tried to crash the skies with an insatiable craving for pepperoni.<br/><br/>The incident allegedly occurred in August 2024, but somehow managed to go undetected until now. Experts speculate that the Fancy Bear hacker group was involved, known for their dastardly deeds like leaking World Anti-Doping Agency data and hacking into the US Democratic National Committee's email account (to send them a strongly-worded email complaining about the lack of decent Wi-Fi at DNC events).<br/><br/>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz has called on Russia to "pay a price" for this cyber-attack, but not before having a few words with Russian President Vladimir Putin over their favorite ice cream flavors. Sources close to the Kremlin confirm that Putin was furious when told he was being served chocolate, when in fact he demanded strawberry.<br/><br/>As tensions escalate between Berlin and Moscow, Germany's air navigation service provider has confirmed that its office communication system was hacked, but not before sending out a mass email with a link to a cat video. "It was just a moment of weakness," said a spokesperson for the agency. "We're working on patching up our security, but in the meantime, we'll just have to stick to using carrier pigeons like everyone else."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russia has denied all allegations, claiming they were simply trying to get ahead in the cyber-attack game by... um... accidentally launching a zombie apocalypse simulation virus that started eating everyone's lunch. Don't worry, it was just a test.<br/><br/>In related news, the UK government announced today that they're launching an investigation into whether Russia is behind a series of mysterious catnaps occurring throughout the country. "We take these allegations very seriously," said a spokesperson for the Ministry of Defence. "I mean, who hasn't had their socks pilfered by a mischievous feline at some point?"<br/><br/>UPDATE: Russian President Vladimir Putin has just released a statement claiming he's not responsible for any cyber-attacks and that his cat is actually a vegan with a PhD in cybersecurity.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
