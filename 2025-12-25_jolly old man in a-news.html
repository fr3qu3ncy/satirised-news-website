        <p>POPE LEO DEMANDS WORLD PEACE, BUT FORGETS TO MENTION HIS OWN PAST DISAGREEMENTS<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Pope Leo has called for an end to conflicts around the world in his Christmas speech. However, it seems he forgot to include himself in the list of people who need to stop fighting. Sources close to the Vatican confirm that Pope Leo and the Church have been locked in a heated dispute with the local pizza delivery guys over the past 12 months.<br/><br/>The Pope's Urbi et Orbi address, which is traditionally delivered by the pontiff on Christmas Day to worshippers gathered in Vatican City, was met with confusion and amusement from the crowd. As he began to speak, a group of elves, who had apparently snuck into the event, started singing "Jingle Bells" off-key and completely drowned out the Pope's message.<br/><br/>"I'm calling for an end to conflicts around the world," said Pope Leo, trying to be heard above the din of the elves. "From God, let us ask for justice, peace, and stability... and a decent cup of coffee in the Vatican cafeteria."<br/><br/>As he continued to speak, a group of reindeer suddenly appeared on stage, causing chaos and disrupting the proceedings. The reindeer were wearing tiny little elf hats and seemed to be enjoying themselves immensely.<br/><br/>In his speech, Pope Leo specifically mentioned conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East, but forgot to mention his own disagreements with the local pizza delivery guys over tips and late fees. When asked about this by reporters, the Pope simply shrugged and said "Oh, that? Just a little Christmas miracle."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of protesters outside the Vatican held up signs reading "Free Pizza" and "Stop the Tip-Sharking." It's unclear what impact these protests will have on the global peace efforts.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>As this story was going to press, it was revealed that Pope Leo had actually called for an end to conflicts... in his own backyard. Sources close to the Vatican confirm that a long-standing feud between the Pope and the local cat population has been put on hold until after New Year's Eve.<br/><br/>In related news, the elves have started selling their own line of Christmas merchandise, including "Jingle Bells" t-shirts and "I Survived the Pope's Speech" mugs.</p>
