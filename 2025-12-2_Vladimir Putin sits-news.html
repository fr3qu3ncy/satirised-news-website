        <p>STEVE WITKOFF'S MOSCOW MEET-CUTE: A COMEDY NEWS STORY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy to Ukraine, has been invited to have tea and crumpets with Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin. Sources close to the White House confirm that Witkoff will be accompanied by none other than Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law and self-proclaimed expert on all things Ukraine.<br/><br/>The meeting is expected to take place in a cozy little café near Red Square, where Putin will no doubt regale Witkoff with stories of his bravery during the war. Meanwhile, Kushner will be busy negotiating a deal for a new Trump Tower in Moscow, because priorities, right?<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! As Witkoff and Kushner sipping their tea, they'll be joined by none other than Sir Keir Starmer, the UK Prime Minister, who's been invited to provide some much-needed British stiff upper lip to the proceedings. And, of course, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky will also be on hand to remind everyone that he's still got his country's sovereignty to negotiate.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, sources close to the Kremlin confirm that Putin has asked Witkoff and Kushner to wear funny hats during the meeting, because "it's good for morale." And if anyone asks, it's all about the "diplomatic" vibes, innit?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside the café, a group of protesters have gathered, holding signs that read "We're not surrendering!" and "Putin's got a bad haircut!" Ah, the usual.<br/><br/>In other news, the White House has released a statement saying they're "very optimistic" about the talks. When asked what this means in layman's terms, a spokesperson replied, "Uh, it means we're pretty sure Steve Witkoff won't get kidnapped by Russian spies... again."<br/><br/>So, stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling saga of diplomacy and tea-time shenanigans!<br/><br/>UPDATES<br/><br/>* Ukrainian officials confirm that they've received a batch of fresh-baked cookies from the Kremlin, courtesy of Putin's personal baker. "They're very good," said one official.<br/>* Jared Kushner has been spotted trying to negotiate a deal for a Trump-branded toaster factory in Ukraine. Because, you know, priorities.<br/>* Steve Witkoff was seen practicing his "serious diplomat face" in front of the mirror earlier today.
