        <p>**BREAKING: "Camite" Chaos: World War One-Era Chemical Used on Georgian Protesters, Investigation Finds**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it's come to light that anti-government demonstrators in Georgia were subjected to a sinister form of crowd control. And by "sinister," we mean completely and utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>According to our investigation, the water cannon used on protesters in Tbilisi contained an agent called... (dramatic music) ...camite! That's right, folks, it seems the Georgian authorities went back in time to World War One and borrowed a chemical from the trenches. Because, why not?<br/><br/>Dr. Konstantine Chakhunashvili, a pediatrician who was among those sprayed by the water cannon, described the sensation as feeling like his skin was burning. "It was worse when trying to wash it off," he said. Well, that's just peachy.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Lasha Shergelashvili, a former head of weaponry for Georgia's riot police, came forward and revealed that he used to test camite for use in water cannon back in 2009. And by "test," we mean they found out how long it takes for people to start vomiting and getting headaches.<br/><br/>"I couldn't breathe freely after testing it," Mr. Shergelashvili said, "but hey, at least the protesters got a free facemask with their camite-infused water cannon experience!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Gela Khasaia, one of the protesters who was sprayed by the water cannon, is seen streaming from his eyes in a promotional video for eye drops. His skin burned after being sprayed, and he's still recovering from the trauma.<br/><br/>The Georgian authorities have denied any wrongdoing, saying their investigation findings are "absurd." We're no experts, but it seems like they might be trying to cover up something... or maybe they just didn't know what camite was.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. The next time someone tells you that the government is on your side, just tell them about camite and watch their smile fade away like a ghostly apparition.<br/><br/>**In related news:**<br/><br/>* Georgia's parliament has announced plans to introduce a new law requiring all protesters to wear hazmat suits at all times.<br/>* A group of Ukrainian hackers has offered to create a camite-detecting app for an estimated $50,000.<br/>* The United Nations has issued a statement condemning the use of camite as "a clear breach of human rights and international law."</p>
