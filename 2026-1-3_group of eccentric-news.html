        <p>BREAKING: Visitors of the Mitsumine Shrine Spent the Night There, and it was a Real Party<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, more than 100 people ended up sheltering in a shrine on a mountain top in Japan after roads around it were shut off due to heavy snowfall. But don't worry, it wasn't all doom and gloom – they had a real hoot!<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was just the guy running the shrine's snack bar), the overnight guests had a blast playing hide-and-seek among the Shinto shrines and shrubs, while being served an endless supply of hot chocolate and freshly baked snowflake-shaped cookies.<br/><br/>"It was like one big happy family," said Taro Yamada, the snack bar owner. "Except for the guy who tried to sneeze out a snowball – that didn't quite end well."<br/><br/>The visitors, ranging from toddlers to pensioners (okay, it was mostly just a bunch of weirdos), were initially planning on enjoying a quick pit stop at the shrine before heading home. However, with roads closed and visibility down to near zero, they found themselves stuck for the night.<br/><br/>"We thought we'd be out in no time," said Yumi Nakamura, one of the stranded visitors. "But then we realized that we had a fantastic excuse to have an impromptu slumber party – and who needs Netflix when you've got snow-covered mountain views?"<br/><br/>The shrine's staff, who were initially worried about providing for the unexpected guests, ended up having a blast too. They even set up a mini-game night with a "Guess Who's Afraid of Snow?" theme, which proved to be a real hit (pun intended).<br/><br/>"We didn't know what to expect," said Shrine Staffer Koji Tanaka. "But it turned out that we had the perfect storm for an unforgettable snow-day – and not just because of the actual snow!"<br/><br/>In related news, Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has been spotted sporting a bright orange ski suit while attempting to navigate the shrine's parking lot in her fancy-schmancy government car. Witnesses claim she was heard yelling something about needing "more female toilets" as she skidded to a stop mere inches from a group of bemused schoolchildren.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Ms. Takaichi merely smiled and said, "Well, when life gives you snow – make snow angels...and hot chocolate...and cookies..."<br/><br/>Additional Reporting by:<br/><br/>* The guy running the shrine's snack bar<br/>* A bunch of random witnesses who happened to be in the area<br/>* Some dude with a camera who was just there to take selfies<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates, folks!</p>
