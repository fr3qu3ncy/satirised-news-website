        <p>"Rodriguez Named Interim President: Trump Promises 'Most Epic Dance Party' in Venezuelan History"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Delcy Rodriguez has been named interim president of Venezuela by President Donald Trump. And what's more surprising than that? The fact that Trump promised to throw the most epic dance party the country had ever seen.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Trump was seen practicing his best salsa moves in the Oval Office before making the announcement. "We're going to make Venezuela great again," he said, "and by 'great,' I mean we'll have the hottest dancing president the world has ever known."<br/><br/>Rodriguez, who was seen sporting a sparkly rainbow-colored jumpsuit at her news conference, seemed less than thrilled about the prospect of being the US's puppet leader. "We Venezuelans are not interested in becoming a colony," she said, "but we're happy to dance our way out of this economic crisis."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, opposition leader Maria Corina Machado was spotted on Instagram dancing with her cat, Purrfecto, and captioning it "Viva la Venezuela libre!" (Long live free Venezuela!). But insiders claim that Trump has already promised Rodriguez a spot in the upcoming Venezuelan Dance Competition, which is set to be held at the Kremlin.<br/><br/>In related news, Nicolas Maduro was seen being carted away by Secret Service agents while shouting "You can't handle the truth! I'm still president!" (He later tweeted that he was just joking about the whole thing and had already planned his comeback as a YouTube influencer).<br/><br/>And Edmundo González, the opposition candidate who Trump refused to recognize, has been spotted sipping margaritas with Elton John at a secret underground club in Caracas. When asked for comment, Gonzalez simply winked and said "Stay tuned, amigos."<br/><br/>"Rodriguez's Rise to Power: A Step-by-Step Guide"<br/><br/>1. Delcy Rodriguez becomes interim president after President Trump declares Nicolás Maduro a wanted man.<br/>2. Rodríguez promises to make Venezuela great again... through dance.<br/>3. Trump threatens to send in the marines if Rodríguez doesn't comply with US demands (which include, but are not limited to, hosting a televised dance-off).<br/>4. Rodriguez's brother Jorge becomes her chief advisor and is seen whispering instructions into her ear while she practices her choreography.<br/>5. The US government announces plans to send a team of expert dancers from the Miami Dolphins cheerleading squad to "help" Rodríguez with her presidential duties.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, amigos!</p>
