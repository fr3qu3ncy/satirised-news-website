        <p>ISRAEL REVOKES LICENSES OF 37 AID GROUPS WORKING IN GAZA, CITES "RESTRICTIVE" AND "UNACCEPTABLE" NEW REGISTRATION RULES<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the international community scratching its head, Israel has decided to revoke the licenses of 37 aid groups working in Gaza. But don't worry, it's not because they're being mean, it's just because they failed to meet the new registration rules.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Israeli government, the aid groups were asked to provide "complete" personal details of their staff, which is code for "tell us what your accountant's middle name is". And let me tell you, those pesky aid workers just couldn't be bothered to fill out that many forms.<br/><br/>Among the affected organizations are ActionAid, the International Rescue Committee, and the Norwegian Refugee Council. Oh no, it seems like they'll have to pack up their tents and leave Gaza in 60 days or less. But wait, there's more! The licenses of CARE, Medico International, and Medical Aid for Palestinians will also be suspended.<br/><br/>But don't worry, Israel assures us that aid will still be delivered through "approved and vetted channels", which is code for "we'll just send some guys in a van with a bunch of Band-Aids". And let's not forget the UN agencies, bilateral partners, and humanitarian organizations that are still allowed to operate. Because, you know, those guys are always reliable.<br/><br/>The move has been met with fierce criticism from foreign ministers from 10 countries, including the UK, who called it "restrictive" and "unacceptable". But Israel just shrugged it off, saying "Hey, we're not trying to be mean, we're just trying to prevent terrorist operatives from infiltrating humanitarian structures... or something".<br/><br/>In a statement, Israel's Minister of Diaspora Affairs and Combating Antisemitism, Amichai Chikli, said: "The message is clear: humanitarian assistance is welcome — the exploitation of humanitarian frameworks for terrorism is not." Which is code for "We're trying to stop people from using aid as an excuse to throw rocks at us".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, UN-backed experts have said that there have been improvements in nutrition and food supplies in Gaza since a ceasefire was brokered between Israel and Hamas in October. But 100,000 people still experience "catastrophic conditions", because who needs personal details of aid workers when you can just wing it with some Band-Aids?<br/><br/>And in other news, Donald Trump has announced that he hopes to reach phase two of the Gaza ceasefire "very quickly". Because what's a little conflict between Israel and Hamas without a celebrity endorsement?</p>
