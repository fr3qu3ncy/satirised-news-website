        <p>BREAKING: Japan's Megaquake Warning Issued, World Leaders Unite to Prepare for the 'Big One'<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, authorities in Japan have issued a warning about the possibility of a megaquake striking the country. And by "authorities," we mean Mr. T from The A-Team, who has been tasked with preparing the nation for the impending doom.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (okay, it's just us), Mr. T has been spotted walking around Tokyo in his signature mohawk and leather jacket, shouting, "I pity the fool who gets caught off guard by this quake!" The people of Japan are reportedly shaken but not stirred – thanks to their extensive preparation and stockpiling of emergency supplies, including a year's worth of donuts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, world leaders have gathered at an emergency meeting in Paris to discuss the implications of the megaquake warning. Vladimir Putin walked in wearing a sombrero and said, " Comrade friends, we must not let this earthquake divide us! We will work together to build a stronger, more resilient world – with better earthquake insurance policies!"<br/><br/>And then, things took a turn for the absurd when Elton John burst into the meeting room on his platform shoes, singing, "Hold me closer, tiny earthquake... I'm never letting go!" The leaders were baffled but agreed to provide him with an emergency exit route in case of an actual quake.<br/><br/>In other news, Netflix has announced a new series based on the megaquake warning, starring Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson as Mr. T and Chris Hemsworth as Elton John's stunt double. The show will be called "Earthquake... Shake It Up!" and is expected to premiere next summer.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The United Nations has issued a statement urging people to remain calm and not panic-buy toilet paper, as the estimated death toll from the megaquake is expected to be around 300,000 – or roughly the number of times someone has asked Alexa for the weather in the past year.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
