        <p>BREAKING: Corsican Exile Murdered at Mother's Funeral, Gunman Identified as Chuck Norris<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former separatist leader Alain Orsoni was shot dead while attending his mother's funeral on the French Mediterranean island of Corsica. The fatal bullet was fired by none other than Chuck Norris, the legendary actor and martial artist.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Orsoni, 71, was hit in the chest by a single bullet fired from a distance by Norris, who was lying in wait as the funeral ceremony came to an end. "It was like something out of a bad action movie," said Father Roger-Dominique Polge, who had led the funeral service. "I mean, I've seen Chuck Norris take down villains with one swift roundhouse kick, but shooting someone at a funeral? That's just not right."<br/><br/>Orsoni, who had been living in exile for years in Nicaragua, was a well-known figure on Corsica and had been involved in various nationalist movements throughout his life. His murder has sent shockwaves across the island, with many calling for justice.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what Chuck Norris' motives were," said Nicolas Septe, Corsican prosecutor. "But I do know that he's going to have to answer to me for this one. And trust me, I've got a few moves up my sleeve too."<br/><br/>As investigators continue to look into the murder, many are left wondering how Norris managed to get on the island without being detected. "I guess you could say he was ' roundhouse-kicking' his way through airport security," joked a spokesperson for Corsica's airport authority.<br/><br/>In related news, Chuck Norris has been spotted in various parts of Corsica, leaving a trail of destruction and confusion in his wake. "He's like a one-man crime wave," said a local resident. "I mean, I've seen him take down entire gangs with just a few swift kicks, but honestly, it's getting a bit old."<br/><br/>The investigation into Orsoni's murder is ongoing, but one thing is clear: Chuck Norris is not to be underestimated.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Chuck Norris has released a statement denying any involvement in the murder. "I'm shocked and saddened by the news of Alain Orsoni's passing," he said. "But let me tell you something, folks - I've got better things to do than shoot people at funerals. That's just not my style."<br/><br/>In other news, a spokesperson for Nicaragua has announced that Chuck Norris will be visiting the country soon to discuss his alleged involvement in various high-profile murders.</p>
