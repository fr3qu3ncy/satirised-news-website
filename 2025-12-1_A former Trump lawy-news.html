        <h2>A US appeals court has ruled that Alina Habba, former personal lawyer to President Donald Trump, is no longer qualified to be the lead prosecutor in New Jersey due to her lack of a law degree from Harvard and poor knowledge of popular songs like "I Will Survive".</h2>

        <p>**APPEALS COURT DISQUALIFIES EX-TRUMP LAWYER ALINA HABBA AS NEW JERSEY PROSECUTOR (THE COMEDY EDITION)**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a US appeals court has ruled that President Donald Trump's former personal lawyer, Alina Habba, is no longer qualified to be the lead singer in a local bar band. I mean, who needs a license to prosecute crimes when you can do it with a mean rendition of "I Will Survive"?<br/><br/>The decision came after three men facing criminal charges in New Jersey argued that Habba's appointment was unlawful – mainly because she couldn't remember the words to the song. A federal judge ruled in their favour in August, and now Habba is no longer allowed to serve as US Attorney for New Jersey.<br/><br/>This marks the third time this week a Trump-appointed prosecutor has been disqualified. First, it was Bill Essayli, who was told he couldn't be the lead guitarist in a local rock band because he didn't know how to play "Stairway to Heaven" on his air guitar. Then, it was Sigal Chattah, who was found not to be lawfully serving as acting US attorney – mainly because she kept singing "I Will Survive" at staff meetings.<br/><br/>Habba, 41, first joined Trump's personal legal team in 2021 after reportedly meeting him at his golf club in Bedminster, New Jersey. She went on to represent Trump in his hush-money trial in New York last year, where he was convicted of falsifying business records – mainly because he kept using Comic Sans as his font.<br/><br/>In a statement, three lawyers who had challenged Habba's authority said this marks "the first time an appeals court has ruled that President Trump cannot usurp longstanding statutory and constitutional processes to insert whomever he wants in these positions" – mainly because they wanted to see more of the Kardashians on TV.<br/><br/>The appellate judges found that Habba's appointment was unlawful because she didn't have a law degree from Harvard, which is apparently required for all prosecutors in New Jersey. When asked for comment, Habba said she would appeal the decision – mainly because she wanted to wear her favourite "Make America Great Again" hat on TV again.<br/><br/>Monday's ruling may force the justice department to find a new prosecutor to supervise federal criminal cases in New Jersey – someone who can actually remember the words to "I Will Survive". The BBC has contacted Habba's office, the White House, and the Department of Justice for comment – mainly because we wanted to see if they had any decent snacks in their break rooms.<br/><br/>In other news, a US Navy commander was ordered to stop striking boats in Venezuela after he was accused of using too many emojis in his emails. And, in a separate development, a white house doctor released Trump's MRI results, which showed that he still has a functioning anus – mainly because we all wanted to know if that was true or not.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**: We've just received word that Alina Habba is being replaced as US Attorney for New Jersey by Elmo from Sesame Street. When asked why, a justice department spokesperson said "well, at least he knows how to say 'I Will Survive' with the right inflection".</p>
