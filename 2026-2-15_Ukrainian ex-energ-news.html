        <p>BREAKING: Former Energy Minister Detained While Trying to Leave Country with a Sack of Potatoes and a Disco Ball<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian authorities have detained former energy minister German Galushchenko while attempting to flee the country with a suspiciously large number of potatoes. Sources close to the investigation revealed that Galushchenko was trying to leave Ukraine on a train, but was stopped at the border by detectives from the National Anti-Corruption Bureau (Nabu). When questioned about the unusual cargo in his luggage, Galushchenko allegedly claimed he was taking the potatoes to a "very important energy conference" in Poland.<br/><br/>However, witnesses on the scene reported seeing Galushchenko attempting to sell the potatoes to other passengers on the train, and one brave soul even accused him of using the potatoes as a makeshift disco ball to distract from his own guilt. "I couldn't believe my eyes," said a shaken passenger. "He was just spinning that potato around like it was going out of style."<br/><br/>Galushchenko's detention comes as he faces legal proceedings after being dismissed in a corruption scandal involving the embezzlement of $100m (£75m) from Ukraine's energy sector. The ex-minister has been accused of orchestrating a scheme to siphon off funds, using them to buy lavish gifts for his family members and, allegedly, to fund his own secret passion – competitive line dancing.<br/><br/>Despite the serious nature of the allegations against him, Galushchenko remains defiant, insisting that he is "innocent until proven guilty...and even then, not so guilty." His lawyer has issued a statement claiming that his client's detention is merely an attempt by Nabu to "harass" him due to his alleged "tough stance on corruption."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned Galushchenko's actions as "utterly unacceptable and a clear breach of Ukraine's energy policy." When asked for comment, Zelensky quipped, "I think we've finally found the root cause of our energy problems – it was just German trying to make a quick buck by selling potatoes on the black market."<br/><br/>Galushchenko is currently being held in a special unit at Nabu headquarters, where he will be interrogated further about his involvement in the scandal and his alleged love of disco balls.</p>
