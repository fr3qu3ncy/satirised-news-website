        <p>BREAKING: Nigerian Authorities Confirm Release of Remaining Abducted Students, But Not Before Chaos Ensues<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Nigerian authorities have confirmed that all remaining students abducted from St Mary's Catholic school in Niger state last month have been released - but only after a series of unexpected mishaps.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the release was preceded by an impromptu performance by Sampa the Great, who suddenly appeared at the scene and began singing her hit single "Very Cool" in front of the relieved students. The 1970s Zamrock revivalist's soulful voice seemed to hypnotize the kidnappers, rendering them temporarily powerless.<br/><br/>As the students were being led out of captivity, a stray giraffe wandered onto the scene and began causing chaos by knocking over cameras and equipment. The authorities were forced to divert the students' procession around the wayward animal, which was later revealed to be a long-lost cousin of Elton John's famous white suit.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, nearby villagers, inspired by the release, spontaneously broke into a choreographed dance routine to celebrate the news. Unfortunately, their rendition of the "Floss" quickly devolved into a series of awkward flailing and tripping, leaving some students giggling uncontrollably while others looked on in confusion.<br/><br/>Details Emerge About Rescue Operation<br/><br/>Sources close to the authorities revealed that the rescue operation was led by none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who had been secretly training Nigerian security forces in the art of demigod-level combat. The Rock's team allegedly employed a combination of stealth, cunning, and rock-solid strategy (pun intended) to outmaneuver the kidnappers.<br/><br/>"It was like a WWE match out there," said one eyewitness. "The Rock took down the bad guys with his trademark 'People's Elbow' move while simultaneously dodging a hail of gunfire from an unexpected source: David Hasselhoff, who had somehow managed to infiltrate the area and begin singing 'Looking for Freedom.'"<br/><br/>Parents Overjoyed<br/><br/>Overjoyed parents gathered at St Mary's Catholic school to welcome their children back home. However, the reunion was briefly disrupted when someone accidentally turned on a giant inflatable unicorn, causing widespread confusion among both students and adults.<br/><br/>"We were worried sick about our kids," said one parent, wiping away tears of joy. "But now that they're safe and sound, we can finally get back to more pressing matters... like planning the perfect graduation party."<br/><br/>In Conclusion<br/><br/>As the dust settles on this chaotic episode, authorities have assured the public that all remaining students are now accounted for - minus a few who had somehow managed to sneak off with a stash of pilfered snacks from the school cafeteria.</p>
