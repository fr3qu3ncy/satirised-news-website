        <h2>BREAKING: Iranian Minister Demands Falafel, Baseball, and Apologies in Exchange for Nuclear Deal</h2>

        <p>BREAKING: Iranian Minister Has a Pint-Sized Problem with America<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Majid Takht-Ravanchi, Iran's deputy foreign minister, has declared that the ball is in America's court to prove that they want to do a deal. But it seems like nobody told him about the whole "ball" thing, because he's also got a beef with Major League Baseball for not including Iran in their World Series schedule.<br/><br/>"I mean, what's up with that?" Takht-Ravanchi said in an interview with the BBC. "We've got some great baseball players over here who can take on the Yankees any day of the week. It's time we get our due."<br/><br/>The Iranian minister also claimed that Iran is ready to consider compromises to reach a nuclear deal with the US, but only if they agree to lift sanctions and replace them with a lifetime supply of falafel.<br/><br/>"If they're sincere, I'm sure we'll be on the road to an agreement," Takht-Ravanchi said. "And by 'sincere', I mean they have to promise not to send any more Taylor Swift CDs to our leader's mansion."<br/><br/>But it seems like America is having some trouble getting their act together, according to Takht-Ravanchi.<br/><br/>"The issue of zero enrichment is not an issue anymore and as far as Iran is concerned, it's not on the table anymore," he said. "Although, I mean, have you seen the new 'Tehran Thrashers' roller derby team? They're totally crushing it."<br/><br/>The Iranian minister also expressed concern about the American president's conflicting messages, saying that Trump keeps talking about regime change and war, but then says they want to negotiate.<br/><br/>"We're not hearing that in the private messages," Takht-Ravanchi said. "It's like he's trying to negotiate a better deal on his next haircut or something."<br/><br/>And just to drive the point home, Takht-Ravanchi also warned America that another war would be "traumatic, bad for everybody... everybody will suffer, particularly those who have initiated this aggression".<br/><br/>"I mean, we've got some great military leaders over here," he said. "They can take on the US army and come out on top, no problem."<br/><br/>In related news, the White House has announced that they're sending a team of negotiators to Iran to talk about the nuclear deal, but only if they agree to bring their A-game – and by 'A-game', we mean their entire baseball team.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Sources close to the negotiations have revealed that the US is planning to offer Iran a special deal: a lifetime supply of Doritos for their uranium stockpile. But it's unclear whether this will be enough to satisfy Takht-Ravanchi's falafel demands.</p>
