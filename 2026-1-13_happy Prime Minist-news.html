        <p>GREENLAND STANDS FIRM: "WE CHOOSE DENMARK OVER US - AND WE ALSO CHOOSE PIZZA"<br/><br/>In a bold move that has left the world in stitches, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen declared today that his island nation would choose Denmark over the United States if they were forced to make a decision. And, in an unexpected twist, he added that they also preferred pizza over tacos.<br/><br/>The statement was made at a joint press conference with Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen, who was seen giggling uncontrollably behind her podium. Nielsen's words were met with thunderous applause from the crowd of Greenlandic Elvis impersonators and Danish Smørrebrød enthusiasts in attendance.<br/><br/>"We choose Denmark because they're our buddies," said Nielsen, adjusting his bright orange life jacket. "And we also choose pizza because, let's be real, who doesn't love a good slice?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump's tweet about the situation was met with widespread confusion: "Just spoke to Greenland and they said 'Yaaas, Uncle Donald!' Wait, what? #MakeGreenlandGreatAgain"<br/><br/>As the news spread like wildfire, people from around the world took to social media to express their shock and amusement. One Twitter user quipped, "I think Trump just got Greenland-ized" while another joked that Nielsen's statement was a clever ploy to distract everyone from the island's real issue: a severe shortage of IKEA furniture.<br/><br/>The situation has also led to an unexpected diplomatic breakthrough between Denmark and the US. In response to Nielsen's statement, Danish Prime Minister Frederiksen revealed that she had secretly been working on a new recipe for Danish pastries with none other than Kanye West.<br/><br/>"Who knew the key to world peace was through flaky pastry?" she asked, beaming with pride.<br/><br/>And so, as the world continues to spin, one thing is clear: Greenland has spoken, and it's all about the pizza.</p>
