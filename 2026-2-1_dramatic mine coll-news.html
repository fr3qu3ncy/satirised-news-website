        <p>BREAKING: MINE COLLAPSE IN DR CONGO LEAVES MORE THAN 200 DEAD, SURVIVORS CLAIM THEY WERE MINING FOR COLTAN WHILE LISTENING TO FRESH PRINCE OF BEL-AIR ON THEIR CELLPHONES<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, more than 200 people have lost their lives in a mine collapse in eastern Democratic Republic of Congo. According to reports from the rebel-controlled region, the mine gave way on Wednesday due to heavy rains, but what's really puzzling is that the miners were allegedly listening to "Jump" by Kris Kross while digging for coltan - a mineral used to manufacture electronics such as smartphones and computers.<br/><br/>Lumumba Kambere Muyisa, spokesman for the North Kivu region's rebel governor, was quoted as saying, "It's not like they were mining for diamonds or anything. No, no. They were after that sweet, sweet coltan while jamming out to Fresh Prince on their flip phones." When asked about the safety protocols in place at the mine, Muyisa replied, "Safety protocols? Ha! Who needs those when you've got a killer beat like 'Jump' to get you through the day?"<br/><br/>The Congolese authorities have blamed the deaths on the rebels, saying they were putting the lives of civilians at risk through allowing illegal mining without enforcing safety standards. But sources close to the rebel governor say it's all just a big misunderstanding. "We're not heartless villains," said one source. "We're just trying to get our hands on that sweet, sweet coltan so we can afford to upgrade from flip phones to actual smartphones."<br/><br/>The mine collapse has left around 20 survivors in need of medical attention, but they're all doing okay - aside from the guy who got a text from his ex saying he's now single. "That was pretty much the worst thing that happened to me," said the survivor. "I mean, I could've lost my life in a mine collapse, but no, it had to be something as brutal as an ex breaking up with you."<br/><br/>Governor Erasto Bahati Musanga visited survivors of the incident on Friday and promised to do something about the safety concerns at the mine - once he finishes his lunch break. "Don't worry, folks," said the governor. "We'll get to the bottom of this. But first, I've got a meeting with some important people from Rwanda who are offering us some really sweet deals on coltan exports."<br/><br/>The UN has accused the rebel group of imposing taxes on the mining sector for their own benefit - and also accused them of making fun of Taylor Swift's hair in a series of leaked emails. "It's a complicated situation," said a UN spokesperson. "But one thing's for sure: we're not going to let some rebels get away with stealing our coltan without us putting up a fight."<br/><br/>In related news, the BBC has learned that the M23 rebels have partnered with McDonald's to open a series of fast-food restaurants near the mine collapse site - complete with special "Coltan Burger" deals for all miners who can prove they've got at least 50 grams of coltan in their pockets. "It's going to be huge," said one McDonald's spokesperson. "We're talking record-breaking sales, folks. And if you get caught with less than 50 grams of coltan, we'll just give you a Big Mac instead."</p>
