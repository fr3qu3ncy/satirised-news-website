    <div class="article">
        <p>GHANA DEMANDS RUSSIA RETURN "PICK-UP ARTIST" WHO SECRETLY FILMED WOMEN WITHOUT CONSENT<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Ghana has called on Russia to return the country's most infamous "pick-up artist", Vladimir Putinov (aka "Vlad the Seducer"), who was accused of secretly filming women without their consent. Yes, you read that right - Vlad, a 35-year-old self-proclaimed dating guru from Moscow, was said to have used his cunning wits and a pair of sunglasses with a built-in camera to record his romantic conquests.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Ghanaian government, Vlad had been traveling around Africa, preying on unsuspecting women in various countries, including Kenya. His modus operandi? To charm them into bed, then secretly film their intimate moments without their knowledge or consent. And, surprise, surprise - he'd later share the footage online for his fellow "pick-up artists" to admire and learn from.<br/><br/>But now, Ghana has had enough of Vlad's shenanigans. The country's Minister of Technology, Sam George, has invited the Russian ambassador to a meeting to discuss the alleged incident. In a statement, George said, "We will activate every resource in our disposal working with Interpol to bring back this gentleman and make him face justice." Oh, and if Vlad fails to return, Ghana plans to try him in absentia - essentially, they'll just send him a strongly-worded letter telling him he's naughty.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russian officials have confirmed that they do not extradite their citizens, except in extreme circumstances. Hmm, sounds like they're trying to protect one of their own from facing the music. When asked about the situation, Vlad himself had no comment - but sources close to him claimed he was "shocked and offended" by Ghana's demands.<br/><br/>As for the victims, well, let's just say they're not exactly thrilled with Vlad either. One of them, a woman who wished to remain anonymous (but was overheard saying something about " needing a shower after that"), said, "I thought I was being courted by a charming gentleman, but it turned out he was just trying to get a good shot for his YouTube channel." Ouch.<br/><br/>And so, the great Vlad saga continues - with Ghana demanding justice, Russia denying extradition, and Vlad's fans (yes, they exist) defending their hero as a "free spirit" who simply wants to spread the joys of online dating. Well, we can't wait to see how this all plays out...</p>
