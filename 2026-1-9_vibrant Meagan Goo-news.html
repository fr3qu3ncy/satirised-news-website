        <p>The Pair Join Other US Celebrities Reconnecting with Their African Heritage and Taking Up Citizenship (The Comedic Version)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Hollywood's most unlikely couple, Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors, have decided to leave their pampered lives behind and trade in their gold-plated Oscars for... well, not exactly gold, but maybe some shiny new Guinean passports. And it all started with a DNA test that revealed they were secretly 87% African (don't worry, we won't make you do the math).<br/><br/>Yes, folks, these two stars of the hit movie "Creed" and "Think Like a Man" have finally figured out their ancestral roots – and guess what? They're from Guinea! Who knew? Okay, maybe they didn't know, but now they do. And with that knowledge comes the desire to become full-fledged Guineans (minus the dreaded Ebola virus, we assume).<br/><br/>Their application for citizenship has been accepted, and on Friday morning, they landed at Conakry's Gbessia International Airport, where they were greeted by officials wearing slightly-too-tight suits and holding oversized novelty African drums. It was a true "Welcome to Guinea" party – complete with complimentary kola nuts (which we're pretty sure is the Guinean equivalent of a participation trophy).<br/><br/>During their stay in this West African nation, the couple plans to tour the coastal region of Boké, where they'll visit historic slave trade sites (because nothing says "vacation" like a good dose of colonialism and trauma). And who knows? Maybe they'll even learn some traditional Guinean dances – or at least attempt to do the Macarena with modified African flair.<br/><br/>As for their future plans, sources close to the couple hint that they might just decide to make Guinea their permanent residence. Can you imagine it? Meagan Good sipping coffee on a sunny Conakry rooftop, Jonathan Majors trying to haggle over the price of fresh fish at the local market... it's almost too good (or bad) to be true.<br/><br/>Now, before we get ahead of ourselves, let's not forget that this is just another example of celebrities reconnecting with their African heritage (read: trying to seem more interesting on social media). But hey, if it brings some much-needed tourism dollars and publicity to Guinea, then why not? After all, as the great philosopher, Paris Hilton, once said, "That's hot!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for updates on this unfolding drama – or should we say, Guinea-drama?</p>
