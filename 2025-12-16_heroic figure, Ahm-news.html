        <p>"Bondi Beach Hero: The Man Who Was Shot, Tackled Gunman, and Got a Standing Ovation from the Prime Minister...and Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese visited Bondi hero Ahmed al Ahmed in hospital yesterday, after the bystander tried to disarm one of the gunmen in the nation's deadliest gun attack since 1996. But what really happened at the bedside visit was that Albanese broke into an impromptu rendition of "I Will Survive" while wearing a bright pink wig and oversized sunglasses.<br/><br/>As the prime minister began singing, al Ahmed looked on in confusion, thinking it was some sort of crazy dream. But then The Rock himself burst into the hospital room, mic drop-style, and shouted "IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOUR NAME IS!" before proceeding to wrestle a rubber chicken with Albanese.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside the hospital, a group of protesting kangaroos were seen holding signs that read "FREE AHMED" and "ALBANESE FOR PRESIDENT (OF BONDI BEACH)!" The crowd chanted "A-H-M-E-D! A-H-M-E-D!" as they waited for news from inside.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, al Ahmed was shot several times in the shoulder after tackling one of the alleged gunmen. But what nobody knows is that he actually had a prior commitment with a secret society of ninja warriors who were on a mission to save the world from an alien invasion. "I didn't know what I was getting myself into," said al Ahmed, still nursing his wounds. "But I knew I had to protect my family...and my collection of rare vinyl records."<br/><br/>The Bondi Beach shooting has left many questions unanswered, but one thing is certain: this guy's got guts! And by the way, has anyone seen The Rock's phone? He seems to have misplaced it during his wrestling match with Albanese.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just in, US President Donald Trump has called al Ahmed a "TRUE AUSTRALIAN HERO" and demanded that he be knighted immediately. Meanwhile, Elon Musk is reportedly developing a new line of solar-powered guns, just in case.<br/><br/>Ahmed al Ahmed's father told the BBC that his son was driven to act by his "sentiment, conscience, and humanity". We're pretty sure it was actually because he saw an opportunity to get on reality TV and become famous for trying to disarm terrorists. Either way, we salute him!<br/><br/>RE-UPDATE: We've just received word from Bondi Beach authorities that the attack has been upgraded from a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community to a full-blown intergalactic battle between aliens and humans. Stay tuned for further updates...if you dare!</p>
