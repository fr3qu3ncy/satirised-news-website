        <p>INCIDENT AT WALT DISNEY WORLD LEAVES STAFF MEMBER INJURED, BUT NOT AS BAD AS A BEAR IN THE BATHROOM<br/><br/>Orlando, FL - In a bizarre incident that left park-goers stunned, a 400-pound runaway prop boulder at Walt Disney World's Indiana Jones Epic Stunt Spectacular! hit a staff member during a live recreation of the film. The staffer, who has been identified as "Bob," was rushed to the hospital with minor injuries, but not before being treated for what witnesses described as "excessive excitement."<br/><br/>The incident occurred when Bob, trying to relive his glory days as an Indiana Jones extra, attempted to jump into the path of the massive prop boulder. Unfortunately for him, he didn't quite get it together and ended up getting crushed by a giant fake rock.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to save the day like Harrison Ford," said Bob in a statement from his hospital bed. "I guess I misjudged the situation. Next time, I'll stick to my day job as a customer service representative at the food court."<br/><br/>Witnesses reported that the crowd gasped in shock as Bob's body was seen sliding across the ground, leaving a trail of dust and debris in his wake. Paramedics arrived promptly and provided aid to Bob, who was then transported to the hospital for further treatment.<br/><br/>Disney officials have since apologized for the incident and promised to review their safety protocols to ensure that such an event never happens again. When asked if they would be providing any compensation to Bob, a Disney spokesperson replied, "We'll give him all the Mickey-shaped ice cream he can eat."<br/><br/>UPDATE: Bob has been released from the hospital with only minor injuries, including a bruised ego and a lingering fear of giant rocks.<br/><br/>In related news, the staff member who jumped on top of Bob's body to prevent further injury has been awarded the prestigious "Golden Sneaker" award for bravery. When asked about his heroic actions, he replied, "I just did what any self-respecting Disney employee would do in that situation - I saved the day and got a free lunch out of it!"<br/><br/>As for Bob, he's taking this opportunity to rethink his career choices and has decided to pursue a new passion - professional snail racing. When asked about his decision, he said, "It's safer than working at Disney."</p>
