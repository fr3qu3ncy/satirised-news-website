        <p>BREAKING: Russia Receives 38 Soldiers' Bodies, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's Autographed Selfie as Part of Soldier Swap<br/><br/>In a bizarre development in the ongoing conflict between Ukraine and Russia, Kyiv has returned 1,000 bodies to Moscow as part of a soldier swap agreement. But what's got everyone talking is that Russia received not only the bodies but also an autographed selfie of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson from Ukrainian President Zelensky.<br/><br/>According to sources, the selfie was taken during a secret meeting between The Rock and President Zelensky at a McDonald's in Kiev. In it, The Rock gives a thumbs up and is seen holding a Big Mac. It's unclear why Ukraine thought this would be a good idea, but Russia seems to have appreciated the gesture.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what's more surprising, the fact that we got 1,000 bodies back or that Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson autographed himself for us," said Moscow's chief negotiator, Vladimir Medinsky. "It's like he knew we needed a little motivation in these tough times."<br/><br/>The swap also included 38 bodies of Russian soldiers, which were transported on white refrigerated trucks by Ukrainian biohazard-suited employees. Witnesses claim the scene was eerily similar to a Game of Thrones episode, with bodies being unloaded from the trucks and laid out like a medieval market.<br/><br/>"It was like they were waiting for us," said one employee, who wished to remain anonymous. "We just stood there, and then suddenly there were 38 Russians in biohazard suits, saying 'Hey, we're here for the bodies.' It was surreal."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, The Rock has taken to social media to express his support for both sides, posting a series of tweets with hashtags #PeaceForUkraine #LoveForRussia. When reached for comment, he simply said, "Can't have two countries fighting without getting involved in some way, folks!"<br/><br/>The soldier swap agreement was part of a broader deal brokered during talks in Istanbul last year, which aimed to exchange thousands of soldiers' bodies over the course of the conflict. It's unclear what other surprises might be in store for both sides as this saga continues.<br/><br/>UPDATE: As news of The Rock's selfie spread, Ukrainian officials have issued a statement saying they were just "trying to add some humor" to the situation. Russian officials, on the other hand, are now demanding an autographed selfie of Arnold Schwarzenegger in return.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* ZELENSKY CONDEMNS RUSSIAN DRONE STRIKE THAT KILLED FIVE ON PASSENGER TRAIN: In a bizarre twist, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has condemned the Russian drone strike that killed five people on a passenger train in Ukraine's Kharkiv region.
