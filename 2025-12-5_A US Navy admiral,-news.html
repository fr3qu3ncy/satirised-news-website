        <p>BREAKING: Admiral Admits He Was Asked by Chuck Norris to Kill All Survivors<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a US Navy admiral testified before lawmakers that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth did not give the order to "kill them all" during a second US military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean. However, what was revealed in the closed-door hearings was even more astonishing.<br/><br/>Sources close to the investigation have confirmed that Admiral Frank Bradley (who looks suspiciously like Ron Swanson from Parks and Recreation) admitted to receiving a call from Chuck Norris, asking him to take out all survivors of the first strike. "I didn't think twice about it," said Admiral Bradley, sipping on a cold beer while adjusting his mullet. "Chuck Norris doesn't dial 1-800-SURVIVE, he makes you disappear."<br/><br/>As lawmakers reacted to the testimony, Representative Adam Smith (D-WA) was overheard whispering to his colleague, "I think we just found out why Chuck Norris doesn't get a speeding ticket." Meanwhile, Senator Tom Cotton (R-AR) was seen nodding enthusiastically, mumbling something about "roundhouse kicking" and "taking out the trash."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, it has been revealed that the Admiral's testimony was interrupted by a loud "WOOHOO!" from an unknown individual in the back of the room. Eyewitnesses claim it was none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who burst into the hearing room and started high-fiving everyone in sight.<br/><br/>As tensions rise, the US military has confirmed another attack on a boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean, with multiple sources confirming that Chuck Norris personally delivered the order to "take out all scurvy dogs." When asked for comment, The Rock simply grinned and said, "You smell what The Rock is cookin'!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story. In the meantime, we recommend checking your back door – you never know when Chuck Norris might show up.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>It has been brought to our attention that this article contains several instances of fictional characters and events being inserted into a news story.
