        <p>BREAKING: "SHOOTER" DETAINED OVER BROWN UNIVERSITY INCIDENT, POLICE SAY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, police have detained a person of interest in connection with the shooting at Brown University in Rhode Island on Saturday. But wait, it gets even better!<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the suspect was seen wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt, which led investigators to believe he was trying to send a secret message to his buddies, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Arnold Schwarzenegger. When questioned, The Rock simply shrugged and said, "Can't be bothered, dude."<br/><br/>Police Chief Oscar Perez confirmed that the suspect was in his 20s, but refused to reveal any further details, citing "national security concerns." Meanwhile, President Trump tweeted, "Just heard about the shooting at Brown University. Sad! But don't worry, folks, our great President has a plan to stop all shootings... after lunch."<br/><br/>As for the victims, sources close to the investigation revealed that one of them was actually a time-traveling John Cena from the WWE, who had traveled back in time to attend a party at Brown University. When asked about his presence, Cena simply said, "You know what's better than a good ol' fashioned fistfight? A good ol' fashioned shooting!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a vigil is being held on Sunday evening for the community, which will feature a performance by Justin Bieber and a speech from Dolly Parton, who has promised to bring her famous "Jolene" song... but with a twist: it's now about Jolene the shooter.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a bizarre turn of events, the suspect was seen trying to escape in a Segway, which crashed into a Dunkin' Donuts store. Witnesses reported seeing him attempting to flee on foot while shouting, "I'm not the bad guy! I'm just here for the donuts!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story...</p>
