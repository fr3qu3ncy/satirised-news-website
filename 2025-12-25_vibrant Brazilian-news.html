        <p>BREAKING: Former Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro's Surgery for Hernia is a Success, but Who Cares?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the former leader of Brazil, Jair Bolsonaro, has successfully undergone surgery for a double hernia. But let's be real, who isn't carrying around a few extra pounds after eating all those delicious Brazilian BBQs?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the hospital (aka his wife Michelle), Bolsonaro's surgery was a breeze, with doctors and nurses alike whispering among themselves about how "easy" it was to operate on someone as... um, "physically fit" as he is. After all, who needs actual health insurance when you've got a personal physician who owes you a favor?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bolsonaro's eldest son Flávio has announced his candidacy for the 2026 presidential election, because what's more thrilling than another generation of Bolsonaros trying to ruin Brazil? It's like a never-ending soap opera, minus the talent and charisma.<br/><br/>In other news, Brazilian President Lula is still running around with a big smile on his face, completely unaware that he'll be facing off against not one, but two Bolsonaros in the next election. Good luck with that, Luiz! You're going to need it.<br/><br/>And did you hear about Neymar's successful knee surgery? That guy must have had a pre-game ritual involving an entire team of surgeons and a few too many Brazilian soccer stars chanting "Neymar, Neymar" while he was under anesthesia. Talk about teamwork!<br/><br/>On the flip side, Brazil's Congress has been having some serious drama lately – I mean, who needs actual legislation when you can have scuffles in the parliament? It's like they're competing with the WWE for most entertaining government proceedings.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! A group of suspects made off with some valuable artwork in Brazil recently, which is totally not a commentary on the country's economic and social issues at all. I mean, who needs functioning infrastructure or education when you can have fancy paintings to steal?<br/><br/>And finally, Scotland is playing their World Cup games in Boston and Miami. Because what could possibly go wrong with that? It's not like they're going to get lost in the airport or anything (hello, language barrier!).<br/><br/>So there you have it – Brazil's latest news in a nutshell: surgery for hernias, presidential elections, sports drama, and stolen artwork. Who needs actual journalism when you can just copy-paste from BBC News?</p>
