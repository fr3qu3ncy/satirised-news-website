        <p>**BREAKING NEWS**<br/><br/>Pope Leo XIV's Three-Day Lebanon Trip Turns into a 3-Ring Circus: Pope Demands Justice, But Also Orders a Large Pepperoni Pizza with Extra Cheese for the Victims' Families<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Pope Leo XIV's three-day visit to Lebanon took an unexpected detour into a comedy-filled adventure. After praying at the site of the Beirut port blast, the Pope demanded justice for its victims, but not before asking if anyone had seen his favorite leather shoes.<br/><br/>"I'm deeply moved by this tragedy," said Pope Leo XIV, "but I'm also craving some serious Italian food. Does anyone know where I can get a good pepperoni pizza around here?"<br/><br/>The crowd of 150,000 people gathered at Beirut's waterfront looked on in confusion as the Pope began to sing a rendition of "That's Amore" with modified lyrics, substituting "amore" with "justice."<br/><br/>As he celebrated his final Mass, the Pope suddenly interrupted himself to tell a joke: "Why did the ammonium nitrate go to therapy?" Pause. "Because it had a lot of explosive emotions!" The crowd erupted into laughter and applause.<br/><br/>Later that day, the Pope met with relatives of the 218 people who were killed in the blast. However, he got distracted by a group of pigeons flying overhead and started chasing them around the area, shouting, "I'll get you, you feathered fiends!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed, said the Pope's visit to the memorial was "very important," but added that she was still waiting for him to deliver her favorite snack from Italy – prosciutto-wrapped melon.<br/><br/>Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, expressed a similar sentiment: "He's trying to help us find the truth in some sort of way, but first, can someone please tell me where I can get a decent falafel around here?"<br/><br/>The Pope responded by breaking into an impromptu dance routine to "I Will Survive" with modified lyrics, singing about surviving on falafel and pizza.<br/><br/>As the Pope concluded his trip, he declared Lebanon's economic crisis was "just a minor setback," saying, "After all, we've got more important things to worry about – like who ate the last of my favorite chocolates!"<br/><br/>The Vatican has since issued an official statement apologizing for any confusion caused by the Pope's antics and assuring everyone that his demands for justice were not just a joke.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/><br/>In related news, the Pope has been spotted eating a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese at a local pizzeria in Rome. When asked about it, he replied, "Hey, someone's gotta fuel this comedy machine!"</p>
