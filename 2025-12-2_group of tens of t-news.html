        <p>BREAKING: Bulgarians Refuse to Be Euro-ed<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the people of Bulgaria have collectively decided that they're not going to be euro-fied. Like, literally. They've had enough of their government trying to slip in some pesky corruption, and they're not having it.<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of protesters took to the streets Monday night, waving cardboard signs and generally causing a ruckus. It was like a scene from a bad 80s music video – except instead of power ballads, there were chants of "No more corruption!" and "We want euros... but not if it means we have to pay for them".<br/><br/>The government, led by Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov (who's probably just a guy named Bob in real life), tried to sneak in some budget plan that would've raised taxes and hidden all sorts of shady dealings. But the people were like, "Nah, dude. We're not falling for it."<br/><br/>As the protests raged on, masked individuals – who may or may not have been members of a secret society known as "The Bulgarians Who Are Tired of This" – attacked the offices of various political parties. The police showed up in riot gear, but mostly just stood around looking confused.<br/><br/>Bulgarian President Rumen Radev (aka Bob's Boss) called for an end to the violence, saying it was all a "provocation by the mafia". But let's be real, folks – the only thing more powerful than the mafia is the power of the people... or at least, in this case, the power of a really good protest chant.<br/><br/>So, what does this mean for Bulgaria? Well, it means they get to keep their corruption-free (ish) budget plan, and they'll probably just stick with their old currency, the Lev. But hey, who needs euros when you've got Bulgarians being all "No" to your plans?<br/><br/>In other news, a group of German army ammunition has gone missing – likely stolen by a group of mischievous monkeys on a mission to protect the environment from pesky bullets.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The government has abandoned their budget plan, and the people are celebrating. But don't worry, Bob's Boss is still in charge... for now.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* "Crumbling Homes Redress Payouts Top €230M" – because who doesn't love a good redress payout?<br/>* "Puttin' and Trump's Envoy Set For Key Ukraine Talks In Moscow" – it's like they're trying to make us forget about the whole Bulgaria thing<br/>* "Thousands of Rounds Of German Army Ammunition Stolen From Lorry" – seriously, what's going on with these Germans and their ammo?</p>
