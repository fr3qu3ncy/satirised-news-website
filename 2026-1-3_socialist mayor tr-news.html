        <p>New York City's socialist mayor-elect faces a slew of challenges, including funding his lofty promises, navigating rival politicians' interference, and convincing business leaders that his policies are good for them.</p>

        <p>CAN THE DEMOCRATIC SOCIALIST DELIVER ON THE BIG COST-OF-LIVING PROMISES THAT PROPHELED HIM TO VICTORY?<br/><br/>By Madeline Halpert, BBC News<br/><br/>Ah, the eternal conundrum: can this socialist mayor actually deliver on all his promises to make New York City affordable again? We spoke to experts and asked them to weigh in on the likelihood of Mamdani's lofty goals becoming a reality. And by "experts," I mean my dad, who has an opinion about everything.<br/><br/>1. PAYING FOR POLICY PROMISES<br/><br/>It turns out that providing free childcare and public buses isn't as simple as just printing some money (although, let's be real, that does sound like a great solution). No, no. The mayor will need to get creative with funding. Enter: the rich people tax! Yes, because nothing says "progressive" like taking more money from the wealthy.<br/><br/>But seriously, finding funding for all these initiatives is like trying to find a needle in a haystack... or a unicorn. It's just not going to happen. And don't even get me started on the bureaucratic red tape involved in making any of this happen.<br/><br/>2. AVOIDING WHITE HOUSE INTERVENTION<br/><br/>Who needs diplomacy when you can just threaten to withhold federal funds? That's basically what President Trump did to try and scare off Mamdani from running for office. But, surprise, surprise! They ended up having a lovely chat over coffee (or so I'm told). It's like they were old pals.<br/><br/>The real challenge here is that the two politicians have diametrically opposed views on... well, everything. It's like trying to get Ron Burgundy and Veronica Corningstone to agree on anything. Good luck with that.<br/><br/>3. GETTING BUSINESS LEADERS ON BOARD<br/><br/>Imagine being a business leader in New York City right now. You've got the mayor-elect breathing down your neck, promising to shake things up and make everyone's lives better (or so he claims). And you're just over here thinking, "Uh, what about my bottom line?"<br/><br/>It's like trying to get a cat to take a bath – it's not going to happen. Unless... unless the mayor can somehow convince them that his policies are actually good for business. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>4. ADDRESSING PUBLIC SAFETY<br/><br/>Public safety is always a top priority in big cities (read: every city). And New York City is no exception. It's like trying to herd cats – you'll never get it under control. But hey, at least the mayor has a new department of community safety to... um, "safely" address these issues.<br/><br/>Look, I'm not exactly sure what that means, but it sounds good, right? It's like when your parents tell you to "be safe out there" and then promptly send you off to the most sketchy neighborhood in town. You know, for "character-building" purposes.<br/><br/>5. THE FINAL COUNTDOWN<br/><br/>In conclusion (if I had one), Mamdani has got a lot of work ahead of him if he wants to deliver on his promises. It's like trying to eat a whole pizza by yourself – it might look easy from the outside, but trust me, it's not.<br/><br/>So, what can we take away from this? Well, for starters, it's clear that Mamdani is a man of his word (or at least, he says he is). And secondly, if anyone knows how to make New York City affordable again, it's definitely not him.</p>
