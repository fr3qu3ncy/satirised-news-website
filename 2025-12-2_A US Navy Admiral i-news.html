    <div class="article">
        <p>US NAVY ADMIRAL ORDERED SECOND DEADLY VENEZUELA BOAT STRIKE, WHITE HOUSE SAYS... AND SO DID ELVIS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the White House has confirmed that a top US Navy admiral ordered a second round of strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. But that's not all - it seems Elvis Presley himself also gave the order to "kill them all" (except for the ones who were already dead).<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter, Admiral Bradley was overheard saying, "Thank ya, thank ya very much," as he ordered the second strike on 2 September. When questioned about the incident, White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said, "Admiral (Frank) Bradley worked well within his authority and the law... and so did Elvis. He's a true American hero, folks."<br/><br/>The Washington Post recently reported that two people survived the first blast and were still clinging to the burning vessel when they were killed in the second strike. However, sources close to the President have confirmed that these survivors were actually just a couple of partying tourists who stumbled upon the boat by mistake.<br/><br/>As tensions rise between the US and Venezuela, Trump has warned that his efforts to halt Venezuelan drug trafficking "by land" will begin "very soon." But it seems he's already found an ally in Elvis - sources close to the King say he's been practicing his "jailhouse rock" moves, just in case.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, lawmakers on both sides of the aisle have expressed concern over the report of the 2 September incident and have vowed congressional reviews of the strikes. Senator Jacky Rosen (D-NV) said, "If the reports are true, Pete Hegseth likely committed a war crime when he gave an illegal order that led to the killing of incapacitated survivors... but let's be real, folks - Elvis was probably just trying to get in on the action."<br/><br/>In related news, the Venezuelan government has accused the US of stoking tensions in the region, with the aim of toppling the government. But Trump says it's all just a big misunderstanding - "We're not trying to overthrow anyone... unless they're wearing a jumpsuit and singing 'Can't Help Falling in Love' on the side of a mountain."<br/><br/>BREAKING: Trump Holds Brief Phone Call with Elvis<br/><br/>In an exclusive interview, President Donald Trump revealed that he had held a brief phone call with Elvis Presley earlier today. When asked about the details of the conversation, Trump said, "It was all very hush-hush... but let's just say that Elvis is backing me up on this whole Venezuela thing."<br/><br/>When questioned further, Trump added, "I mean, who wouldn't want to be endorsed by Elvis? He's a true American icon - and he's got some great dance moves too. I'm thinking of making him the new Secretary of Defense... or maybe just inviting him to a few more White House parties."<br/><br/>And so the controversy continues...</p>
