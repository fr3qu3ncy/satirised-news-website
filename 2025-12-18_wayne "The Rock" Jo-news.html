        <p>BREAKING: DR Congo Rebels' Withdrawal is Just a Big Distraction, Says Government<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Democratic Republic of Congo's government has announced that the rebel group M23's withdrawal from the key city of Uvira is nothing but a clever distraction tactic. And who better to lead this distraction than the one and only, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson? Yes, you heard that right - The Rock himself has been secretly advising the DR Congo government on how to pull off this masterful move.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the government, The Rock was seen strolling through the streets of Kinshasa, wearing a bright smile and a fedora, as he whispered words of wisdom into the ears of President Felix Tshisekedi. "It's time to bring out the big guns," The Rock allegedly said, before proceeding to flex his massive muscles.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the M23 rebels have been spotted fleeing the city in a fleet of golf carts, led by none other than Elvis Presley himself (in a stunning comeback move). "We're not leaving, we're just... repositioning ourselves for peace talks," said Bertrand Bisimwa, leader of the M23. But don't be fooled - sources close to the rebels confirm that they are actually on their way to Las Vegas to participate in an all-you-can-eat buffet challenge.<br/><br/>And if you thought things couldn't get any stranger, think again! The US government has announced that it will be sending a team of special forces to DR Congo, led by none other than Nicolas Cage. "We're not just there for the peace talks," said Cage, in a statement that left everyone scratching their heads. "No, no - we're actually on a secret mission to find the world's largest diamond. It's said to be hidden deep within the jungle, guarded by a fierce tribe of warrior monkeys."<br/><br/>As the situation continues to spiral out of control, one thing is certain: it's going to be a wild ride in DR Congo.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Rock has just tweeted that he is "LIVING HIS BEST LIFE" in DR Congo, and that the rebels' withdrawal is just a "SMALL PART OF THE BIG PICTURE". Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage has been spotted riding a unicorn through the streets of Kinshasa, shouting "I'M KING OF THE WORLD!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
