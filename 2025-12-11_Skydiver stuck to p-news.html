        <p>FOOTAGE SHOWS SKYDIVER STUCK ON PLANE TAIL, CUTS HIMSELF FREE WITH FLAMETHROWER WHILE PLAYING "WHO LET THE DOGS OUT" BY BAKKAR<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left aviation experts baffled, footage has emerged of a skydiver's parachute wrapping around the tail of a plane in Far North Queensland. But what's even more astonishing is that the skydiver managed to cut himself free with a flamethrower while singing "Who Let the Dogs Out" by Bakkal.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the skydiver, identified as 35-year-old Dave from Brisbane, was attempting to break the world record for most creative ways to exit a plane. However, things took a turn for the worse when his parachute got tangled around the horizontal stabiliser.<br/><br/>As the plane continued to fly, Dave found himself stuck to the tail, flailing about like a marionette on a string. Undeterred, he whipped out a flamethrower and started blasting away at the rope, all while belting out the catchy tune.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get into character," said Dave in an interview. "I mean, who doesn't love a good musical number while stuck to a plane? It's like something out of a Bond movie!"<br/><br/>Miraculously, Dave managed to cut himself free and continued with his dive, landing safely on the ground with only minor injuries.<br/><br/>AUSTRALIAN POLITICIAN BOB KATTER RAISES FIST AT JOURNALIST OVER "LEBANESE HERITAGE" JOKE<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a separate incident, Australian politician Bob Katter was seen raising his fist at a journalist over a joke about his Lebanese heritage.

"It's like he's allergic to humor or something."<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Katter simply shook his fist and muttered, "You just wait till I get out of this chair...!"<br/><br/>SOLAR-POWERED CARS TAKE OVER OUTBACK, WITH ELON MUSK SHOWING UP TO RIDE SHOTGUN<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, solar-powered cars took over the Australian Outback, with Elon Musk showing up to ride shotgun.

The massive bug, which is roughly the size of a small cat, was spotted by entomologists in the Outback.<br/><br/>"It's like something out of a sci-fi movie," said one scientist. "We're talking tentacles, we're talking laser eyes... this thing is going to be the end of humanity as we know it!"<br/><br/>When asked for comment, the bug simply shrugged and said, "Hey, I'm just trying to make a living in this crazy world..."</p>
