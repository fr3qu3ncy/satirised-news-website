        <p>FOR DECADES, ZIA AND OUZE PM SHEIKH HASINA WERE BITTER RIVALS - AND THEIR FEUD DEFINED BANGLADESH'S POLITICS... BUT NOW THEY'RE JUST DEAD AND GONE<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Khaleda Zia, Bangladesh's first female prime minister and arch-nemesis of ousted leader Sheikh Hasina, has kicked the bucket at the ripe old age of 80. The two Begums (yes, that's what we're calling them now) have been locked in a bitter feud for decades, with their rivalry defining Bangladesh's politics like a bad case of chicken pox.<br/><br/>Zia, who was known for her uncompromising leadership style and questionable fashion sense (who wears pink to court?), had been fighting for her life against a prolonged illness. Her condition was so critical that doctors were forced to put her on life support, but even the combined might of their medical expertise couldn't save her.<br/><br/>When news of her death broke, crowds gathered outside Evercare Hospital in Dhaka like they're waiting for the iPhone 13 to drop (but, you know, in a sad and mournful way). Zia's Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP) announced on Facebook that she left us at 6am this morning, leaving behind a legacy of... well, being really good at being mad.<br/><br/>As the wife of Bangladesh's former president Rahman, Zia was initially just a reserved presence alongside her famous husband. But after he got whacked in a military coup in 1981 (RIP, dude), she decided to enter politics and become one of Bangladesh's most formidable leaders. She even managed to get elected as prime minister twice (1991 and 2001), which is impressive considering the country's track record with democracy.<br/><br/>Zia's first term was all about promoting women's education and social development, while her second term was more focused on staging a one-sided election despite opposition demands for a neutral caretaker authority. Yeah, that didn't go so well. Her administration faced sharp criticism over allegations of corruption (shocker), which led to her eventual jailing and house arrest.<br/><br/>But hey, being mad at the government is what kept her in the news, right? And speaking of being mad, Zia was acquitted of corruption charges only after Hasina lost power. Yeah, because that's exactly how it works - you get out of jail just by losing an election. It's like a free pass to do whatever you want.<br/><br/>Now that Zia is gone, the BNP is eyeing a return to power with her son Tarique Rahman as the new leader. Because what could possibly go wrong with another dynasty in politics? And in related news, Pakistan's Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif called Zia "a committed friend of Pakistan," which is just code for "we loved having you be mad at us."<br/><br/>So, farewell to Khaleda Zia, the Begum who kept Bangladesh on its toes. May her legacy live on as a reminder that even in politics, it's all about being mad and wearing pink to court.</p>
