        <p>TRUMP ANNOUNCES 'WARRIOR DIVIDEND' FOR TROOPS, BLAMES DEMS FOR ECONOMIC PAIN (BUT LET'S BE REAL, IT'S ALL ABOUT THE TARZAN-MANAGED-ECONOMY)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Trump announced yesterday that he's giving all 1.45 million US service members a cool $1,776 "warrior dividend" each, because, well, they're just the best. And by "the best," we mean they get to keep their guns and eat more Fritos.<br/><br/>The payment, which totals a whopping $2.57 billion (£1.9bn), is being funded by Trump's beloved tariffs – you know, the ones that have been making everyone else's lives slightly more difficult. It's like he's saying, "Hey, folks, I'm giving you money, but also, don't forget about my tariffs, because those are just peachy."<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Trump also took a moment to tout his economic record, which is basically a highlight reel of him shouting "Fake news!" at every opportunity. He claimed that prices are falling (except for housing, childcare, and healthcare, but who needs those things, anyway?), and that the economy is doing so great that even the Democrats are jealous.<br/><br/>Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer was quick to point out that Trump's words were "completely disconnected from reality," which we can only assume means he's been spending too much time in his bunker with a tub of ice cream. I mean, who needs facts and figures when you have Twitter, am I right?<br/><br/>The speech also included some bonus highlights, such as Trump mentioning former President Joe Biden seven times (we're guessing that's a new record for most mentions of a predecessor in one address), and declaring that the US is "the envy of the entire globe" – which we assume is code for "I'm secretly building a wall around the world to keep all the good stuff inside."<br/><br/>When asked about the speech, Trump's advisors were like, "Uh, yeah, it was totally normal. Just your average Tuesday afternoon address from the President." Meanwhile, Twitter users were busy calling him out for being a big ol' liar, which is basically just part of his charm.<br/><br/>Related:<br/><br/>* TRUMP VOWS TO MAKE US AFFORDABLE AGAIN, AS AMERICANS FEEL THE PINCH (Spoiler alert: it's not going to happen)<br/>* TRUMP HITS THE ROAD TO SELL ECONOMIC MESSAGE AND COUNTER COST OF LIVING CONCERNS (Good luck with that, buddy!)<br/>* NO VOTE COMING ON EXTENDING HEALTHCARE SUBSIDIES, US HOUSE SPEAKER SAYS (Guess that means we're all just stuck with our Fritos)<br/><br/>Stay classy, America!</p>
