        <p>BREAKING: COURT SAYS ADIDAS DIDN'T MISLEAD SHAREHOLDERS, KANYE WEST'S BEHAVIOUR WAS JUST "A TUESDAY"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a San Francisco court has ruled that Adidas did not mislead investors about its relationship with rapper Kanye West, despite the fact that West's behaviour was so unpredictable that even his therapist thought he was "just having a Tuesday".<br/><br/>According to sources close to the case, West's lawyers argued that his antics were just a "phase" and that his anti-Semitic comments were simply a "social experiment gone wrong". However, the court ultimately sided with Adidas, stating that "any reasonable investor would know that partnering with Kanye West is like playing roulette - sometimes you win, but most times you end up with a bunch of Yeezy trainers in storage".<br/><br/>The ruling comes as a relief to Adidas, which had been facing criticism for its handling of the partnership. However, insiders claim that the real reason for the court's decision was because the judges were all huge fans of West's music and didn't want to be seen as "haters".<br/><br/>West himself has taken to Twitter to respond to the news, tweeting "I TOLD YOU I WAS A GENIUS!!!11! MY BEHAVIOUR WAS JUST A FORM OF SELF-PROMOTION!!! NOW IF YOU'LL EXCUSE ME, I HAVE TO GO RECORD SOME NEW SONGS ABOUT HOW GREAT I AM".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, investors who had sued Adidas for misleading them are reportedly "furious" with the court's decision. One investor, who wished to remain anonymous, said "I lost thousands of dollars when Adidas cut ties with West - now it seems like they're just getting off scot-free".<br/><br/>As for West, he has announced plans to start his own sports brand, which will be sponsored by McDonald's and feature a line of trainers shaped like McNuggets. When asked about the move, West said "I'M JUST TRYING TO MAKE THE WORLD A MORE INTERESTING PLACE, ONE PAIR OF SHOES AT A TIME".<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, the Yeezy brand has announced that it will be partnering with a popular fast-food chain to create a line of trainers shaped like burgers. When asked about the move, West said "I'M JUST TRYING TO TAKE MY BRAND TO THE NEXT LEVEL - AND BY NEXT LEVEL, I MEAN TO THE TOP OF THE FOOD CHAIN".<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL UPDATE: In an effort to make amends for its handling of the partnership, Adidas has announced that it will be donating all remaining Yeezy trainers to a local charity. When asked about the move, an Adidas spokesperson said "WE'RE JUST TRYING TO GIVE BACK TO THE COMMUNITY - AND BY COMMUNITY, I MEAN THE KANYE WEST Fan Club".</p>
