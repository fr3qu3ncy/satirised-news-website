    <div class="summery">
        <p>New photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate show that the real scandal is Donald Trump's love for orange pumpkins, Prince Andrew's weird haircut, and Bill Clinton's... well, nothing particularly scandalous about him, actually.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: New Photos from Epstein Estate Show Trump's Love for Orange Pumpkins, Andrew's Haircut, and Bill Clinton's... Wait, What?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the House Oversight Committee has released a new batch of photos from Jeffrey Epstein's estate, revealing the sordid secrets of the wealthy and powerful. And by "sordid," I mean mildly interesting, but mostly just weird.<br/><br/>The nearly 100 photos show a variety of high-profile figures, including US President Donald Trump, former Prince Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (who looks like he's been put through a spin cycle), and former Trump adviser Steve Bannon (who appears to be trying to sneak in an extra hour at the gym).<br/><br/>One particularly revealing image shows Trump standing next to a woman whose face has been redacted. Because, you know, it's not like we've seen that before on Tinder or anything.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Another photo shows Trump smiling with several women, all of whom have had their faces Photoshopped out. It's like he's trying to recreate the entire cast of "The Bachelor" – but without the drama and questionable life choices.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Prince Andrew is spotted in a cropped section of an image taken at a London summit, where he's chatting with Microsoft founder Bill Gates (who looks like he's about to get hit by a jet stream). Because, you know, that's exactly what I want my prince to be doing – networking with tech moguls and trying to get the latest Microsoft updates.<br/><br/>And let's not forget about Bill Clinton! He's shown standing next to Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell (who looks like she's been practicing her evil laugh in front of a mirror) – an image that's sure to send shivers down the spines of all the ladies out there who still think he's the most charming man in the world.<br/><br/>But what really caught my eye was the photo of Steve Bannon speaking with Epstein at a desk. I mean, who doesn't love a good game of "Who Can Sit Closer to the Desk" in a creepy office setting?<br/><br/>And then, just when you thought it couldn't get any weirder, there's an image of an orange pumpkin with a blonde wig carved into it, accompanied by a sign that reads: "Trumpkin. Make Halloween Great Again." Because, you know, what every American wants is a Trump-shaped pumpkin to carve up and show off at their next dinner party.<br/><br/>The White House has responded to the photos by calling them a "Democrat hoax" against Trump – which is pretty rich coming from an administration that's always trying to spin its own controversies into something more palatable for the public. I mean, it's not like they're trying to distract us from their many, many failures or anything.<br/><br/>In conclusion, these new photos from Epstein's estate show that even in the most mundane and banal settings, there's always a chance for Trump to photobomb his way into our lives – much to the delight of every late-night comedian and snarky Twitter user out there.</p>
