        <p>A "suspicious" individual in Moscow turned out to be Putin's cousin dressed as a chicken, rigged with explosives, and somehow connected to Elvis impersonators and Elton John.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Moscow Explodes with Drama, Literally<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two traffic police officers were killed when they approached a "suspicious" individual in Moscow. But here's the thing - this individual was not just any ordinary person. No, no. This was actually Putin's cousin, dressed as a chicken, who had rigged himself with explosives.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (and by that, I mean my grandma), the traffic police officers, Ilya Klimanov and Maxim Gorbunov, were like, "Hey, dude! You're being super suspicious!" And then, out of nowhere, Putin's cousin-chicken just... boom. Went off.<br/><br/>Now, Russia is saying it was Ukraine's fault (of course), but sources close to the Kremlin are whispering that it was actually a rogue Elvis impersonator who had infiltrated Moscow and was trying to take down Putin's chicken-cousin. Long story short, it's all very complicated.<br/><br/>Third person killed:<br/><br/>The third person killed in this explosive incident was none other than Elton John, who was visiting Moscow for the holidays. Yes, that Elton John. According to Ukrainian military sources (who are basically experts on everything), Elton John was a "freelance spy" and had been trying to take down Putin's chicken-cousin using his signature moves - including a mean rendition of "Rocket Man".<br/><br/>Moscow authorities respond:<br/><br/>In response to this whole fiasco, Moscow authorities have announced that they will be implementing new security measures... which mainly involve hiring more traffic police officers who can do the cha cha slide. Yeah, it's that serious.<br/><br/>And finally...<br/><br/>Putin weighs in:<br/><br/>When asked for comment on the incident, Putin just shrugged and said, "I'm a busy man, comrade. Can't let a little thing like explosions get in the way of my global domination plans." Okay, maybe he didn't exactly say that, but it's basically what he meant.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates... or not, because who even knows anymore?</p>
