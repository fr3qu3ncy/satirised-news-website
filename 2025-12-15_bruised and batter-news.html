        <p>Nobel Laureate's Bloody Brawl: Iran's Finest Hour<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iranian Nobel Peace Prize winner Narges Mohammadi was beaten into submission by plainclothes agents while attending a memorial ceremony for Khosrow Alikordi, a human rights activist who died under suspicious circumstances. But that's not all, folks! The beating was so severe that it required two emergency room visits.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (and by eyewitnesses, I mean Ms. Mohammadi's family), around 15 plainclothes agents attacked her at the memorial ceremony in Mashhad, Iran. They pulled her hair, beat her with clubs and batons, and even made a death threat against her mother (because what's a good old-fashioned beating without a little added emotional distress?). Ms. Mohammadi was subsequently taken to the hospital twice, where she received treatment for her "severe and repeated" head and neck injuries.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The Iranian authorities have come out in support of this... let's call it "creative" approach to law enforcement. Mashhad prosecutor Hasan Hematifar claimed that Ms. Mohammadi was arrested because she encouraged others at the memorial ceremony to chant "norm-breaking slogans," which is just a fancy way of saying "she got too rowdy." (I mean, who needs peace and justice when you can have catchy slogans?)<br/><br/>And if you thought things couldn't get any more bizarre, imagine Ms. Mohammadi's surprise when she was accused of co-operating with the Israeli government! Because, you know, that's exactly what Iranian authorities would say to justify a brutal beating: "You're working with our arch-nemesis, Israel!" (It's like they've never heard of scapegoating.)<br/><br/>The Nobel Committee and various human rights groups are calling for Ms. Mohammadi's release, citing her "brutal arrest" and the Iranian authorities' general lack of accountability. But let's be real – who needs a Nobel Peace Prize when you can have a good old-fashioned brawl on the streets of Iran?<br/><br/>In related news, I just heard that Elton John has been hired as a consultant for the Iranian government to help them "improve their image" and "develop more effective crowd-control measures." (Don't worry, he'll be sure to bring his famous piano-playing skills to the next memorial ceremony.)<br/><br/>Stay classy, Iran!</p>
