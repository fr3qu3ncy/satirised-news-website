        <p>The FBI is investigating a fatal shooting of an ICE agent who was playing a Michael Jackson CD on repeat in his car and may have used deadly force because the victim wasn't wearing her seatbelt while trying to escape him for asking directions to Starbucks.</p>

        <p>BREAKING NEWS:<br/><br/>"FBI Agents to Investigate Who, Exactly, Was Trying to Run Over the ICE Agent in Minneapolis Shooting... and Why He Had a Michael Jackson CD Playing on Repeat in His Car"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, officials will examine video footage and policy guidelines as part of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good by ICE agent Jonathan Ross. But we've got some breaking news: it's not just about the shooting itself - it's about the really important stuff.<br/><br/>Sources close to the investigation have revealed that Agent Ross was not only filming the entire incident on his phone, but he also had a Michael Jackson CD playing on repeat in the background while he shot Good. "It was like he was trying to distract us from the real issue here," said one official, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, who does that?"<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Former law enforcement officials told the BBC that a review of the incident could plausibly find the agent was justified in using deadly force because he believed Good was a threat... and also because she wasn't wearing her seatbelt.<br/><br/>"It's like I always say: if you're gonna try to run over an ICE agent, at least make sure your seatbelt is buckled," said former FBI special agent Robert D'Amico. "It's just common sense."<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, local officials have revealed that Renee Good was not actually trying to run over the agent - she was just trying to get away from him because he kept asking her for directions to the nearest Starbucks.<br/><br/>"I mean, who doesn't love a good cup of coffee?" said one official. "But seriously, this is a clear case of mistaken identity."<br/><br/>The investigation is expected to take several weeks, but officials say they're confident that they'll be able to figure out what really happened... and also who ate the last donut in the break room.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Agent Ross has been placed on administrative leave pending the outcome of the investigation. But don't worry, folks - he's still got his Michael Jackson CD, so we're sure he'll be okay.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
