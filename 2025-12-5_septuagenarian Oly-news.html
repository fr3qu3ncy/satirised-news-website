        <p>BREAKING: Eritrea Releases Ex-Cyclist and Other Notorious Jailbirds, Including a Bunch of Unlikely Heroes<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the notorious Mai Serwa prison in Eritrea has released 13 prisoners, including a septuagenarian Olympian cyclist named Zeragaber Gebrehiwot. The release comes after an astonishing 18 years without trial, and we're not even kidding.<br/><br/>Zeragaber, who competed in the 1980 Moscow Olympics when Eritrea was still part of Ethiopia (yeah, it's complicated), has been reunited with his family and is now sipping tea and reminiscing about his glory days on two wheels. "I'm thrilled to be out of that dump," he said, "but I'm even more stoked to have finally mastered the art of riding a unicycle while reciting Shakespearean sonnets."<br/><br/>Among those released alongside Zeragaber were several prominent businessmen, including Tesfalem Mengsteab and Bekure Mebrahtu. These two guys are so rich that they've invested in their own private islands...in Eritrea's equivalent of the Bermuda Triangle.<br/><br/>The Habtemariam brothers, David (engineer) and Matthews (geometrist), were also set free after being held without trial for decades. When asked what they plan to do first, they replied, "We're going to build a time machine and go back to 2007 when we first got arrested. We'll warn ourselves about the impending doom that is Mai Serwa prison."<br/><br/>The release of these notable prisoners has sparked speculation among Eritreans, with some hailing it as a victory for human rights and others attributing it to a clever PR move by President Isaias Afwerki (the 79-year-old strongman who's still never faced an election). "It's a masterstroke," said a government spokesperson, "we've released these prisoners just in time for the holidays. Now they can spend quality time with their families and pretend to be model citizens."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Eritrean government has not issued any statement regarding the releases...because, let's face it, they're too busy trying to figure out how to fix that pesky time machine.<br/><br/>In related news, Berhane Abrehe (the former finance minister who died in prison) has been granted a posthumous pardon for publishing that scathing book about President Isaias. Sources close to the government confirm that Berhane's spirit is now roaming free, sipping coffee and criticizing the government from beyond the grave.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this unfolding saga of human rights abuses, questionable releases, and Eritrean bureaucratic wizardry!</p>
