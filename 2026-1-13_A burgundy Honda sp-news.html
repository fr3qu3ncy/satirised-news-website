        <p>BREAKING NEWS:<br/><br/>ICE AGENT TURNS MINNEAPOLIS INTO GAME OF HONOR OR DEATH, EXPERTS CLAIM<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, federal investigators have been tasked with examining video footage and policy guidelines as part of the investigation into the fatal shooting of Renee Good, 37, by US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent Jonathan Ross in Minneapolis. But what really happened on that fateful day?<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (including a very confused Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson who just happened to be strolling down the street), it appears that Good was simply trying to get away from Ross, who had been following her around the block like a scene from The Matrix. But little did they know, Ross had a special power - the ability to see into the souls of those he encounters.<br/><br/>"I could sense that she was trying to escape," said Ross in a statement. "It's like I have a sixth sense when it comes to domestic terrorists... er, I mean, innocent civilians."<br/><br/>As the story goes, Good, who was driving her burgundy Honda, attempted to make a quick getaway, but Ross, with his trusty ICE-issued ninja gear, managed to stay one step ahead of her. In a flash, he leapt onto the hood of the car and gave chase.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump, in a surprise move, tweeted that Good was "a total loser" and that Ross had done a fantastic job taking her down. And what's more, Trump claimed that the entire ordeal was just a clever ploy by the Democrats to distract from their impending defeat in the upcoming elections.<br/><br/>"We all know that Renee was just trying to get away with some dodgy cheese," said Trump in a statement. "Jonathan Ross is a hero and an absolute genius for taking her down."<br/><br/>Experts have weighed in on the matter, saying that it's not uncommon for ICE agents to have a sixth sense when dealing with potential threats. In fact, Ross had previously been involved in several high-profile cases involving cheese heists and domestic terrorist plots.<br/><br/>"The guy's got instincts like a bloodhound," said one expert. "And let me tell you, I've seen some crazy stuff in my time as an FBI agent, but this takes the cake."<br/><br/>Despite the controversy surrounding the incident, Ross has been cleared of any wrongdoing by his superiors at ICE and has since been promoted to lead a special task force on Cheese-related terrorism.<br/><br/>In related news, the Minnesota Vikings have announced that they will be holding a pre-game ceremony in honor of Good's bravery. And Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has been invited to participate in the ceremony as an honorary cheese-taster.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE 1:<br/><br/>* The FBI has confirmed that Ross's ICE-issued ninja gear was indeed a standard issue item and not, as previously thought, a prototype.<br/>* Good's family has released a statement saying they are still trying to come to terms with the whole ordeal and are seeking counseling to deal with their newfound cheese-related trauma.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE 2:<br/><br/>* The Trump administration has announced plans to establish a new branch of ICE dedicated solely to combating Cheese-related terrorism (CRT).<br/>* Ross has been awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom for his bravery in taking down Good, who was later revealed to be a pastry chef from Minneapolis.</p>
