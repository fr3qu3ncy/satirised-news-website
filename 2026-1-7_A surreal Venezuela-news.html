        <p>The BBC's Comedy News Network<br/><br/>BREAKING: Venezuela Seizure Chaos - "Fear in the Streets" as US Forces Take Over, Maduro Wears Funny Hats<br/><br/>Caracas, Venezuela - In a shocking turn of events, Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro was seized by US forces yesterday, leaving Venezuelans wondering what might happen next. But not us at the BBC's Comedy News Network - we're always one step ahead.<br/><br/>As news of the seizure spread, Caracas residents were seen scurrying about, looking for their nearest exit strategy. "I'm outta here!" exclaimed Marcelo, a local student who had been planning to attend an all-you-can-eat pizza party that night. "I didn't know Maduro was the guest of honor... now I'll have to stick to takeout."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rosa Contreras, a 57-year-old Venezuelan patriot, was spotted waving a Venezuelan flag and shouting "Viva la US intervention!" But only because her cat, Mr. Whiskers, had just won an online cat contest with a photo of himself wearing a miniature Uncle Sam hat.<br/><br/>As the situation unfolded, it became clear that Maduro's seizure was not without its challenges. According to eyewitnesses, the Venezuelan leader had been enjoying a particularly long and satisfying nap at the time of the US operation - but somehow managed to wake up just in time to be taken away in handcuffs. "He had an attitude," said one witness. "Like he was saying, 'You can take my government, but you'll never take my Zzz...!'"<br/><br/>The Cuban government has since reported that 32 members of its security forces were killed during the operation - a number that has been disputed by local bakeries, who claim to have sold at least 50 more cakes than usual in the aftermath.<br/><br/>US President Donald Trump was quick to capitalize on the situation, tweeting "Just took over Venezuela and fixed their oil infrastructure... now if you'll excuse me, I've got a meeting with Elon Musk about turning Mars into a giant golf course."<br/><br/>As for what happens next, many Venezuelans remain uncertain. But we at the BBC's Comedy News Network are confident that it will all work out in the end - after all, we're sure that Acting-President Delcy Rodríguez (who was previously Maduro's closest lieutenant... and also his favorite recipe book author) has a solid plan to stabilize the economy.<br/><br/>And if not? Well, as one Venezuelan resident put it, "If things get too bad, I'll just move to Colombia - they have better Wi-Fi anyway."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story... or at least until we run out of material and have to start making stuff up!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>CORRECTION: We've been informed that Mr. Whiskers, Rosa Contreras's cat, is actually a vegan and has never worn an Uncle Sam hat - sorry about that, folks!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>AND NOW FOR SOMETHING COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...<br/><br/>[Insert random image of Nicolas Cage here]<br/><br/>YOU COULD WIN A FREE VACATION TO CARACAS BY SOLVING THIS PUZZLE:<br/><br/>What has been taken from Nicolás Maduro by the US forces?<br/><br/>A) His keys<br/>B) His passport<br/>C) His lunch money<br/>D) His beard<br/><br/>(Just kidding about the last one... or are we?)</p>
