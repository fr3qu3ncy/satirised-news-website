        <p>BREAKING: Woman Who Blackmailed Son Heung-Min Gets Four Years in Jail, But Still Can't Get Her Hand on His Juicy Bae<br/><br/>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - In a shocking turn of events, a woman who blackmailed former Tottenham captain Son Heung-min has been sentenced to four years in jail. But don't worry, folks, she's still got her eyes on that juicy bae.<br/><br/>According to sources, the woman, who shall remain nameless (but let's be real, we all know it's Kim Kardashian), claimed she was carrying Son's child and extorted $200,000 from him. Because, you know, a celebrity's gotta keep their reputation intact by paying off some random woman's alleged pregnancy.<br/><br/>But little did Son know, this woman had a secret accomplice - none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Yeah, that's right, folks. The Rock was in on it all along. He was like, "Hey, I'll just threaten Son with my WWE moves if he doesn't cough up some cash."<br/><br/>Son, being the good sport that he is, went to the police and reported the whole ordeal. And let me tell you, they were NOT having it. The judge said, "This woman has abused Son's celebrity for her own gain, and we're gonna make sure she pays for it... with four years in jail."<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! During her trial, the woman claimed she was a victim of circumstance and that Son had been flirting with her (yep, you read that right). She even went so far as to say that Son had been sending her "love messages" on Tinder. We're not sure what's more shocking - the fact that she thought she could get away with this or the fact that Son was actually using Tinder.<br/><br/>In related news, we just learned that the woman spent the $200,000 she extorted from Son on luxury goods... including a brand new Porsche and a year's supply of avocado toast. Because priorities, folks.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Rock has since released a statement saying he had nothing to do with the whole ordeal and was actually in a meeting with Elon Musk when it all went down. When asked for comment, Elon simply shrugged and said, "Sorry, dude."</p>
