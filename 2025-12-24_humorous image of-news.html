        <p>BREAKING: Zelensky's Latest Plan to End War in Ukraine Involves Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, Pizza Parties, and a Free Economic Zone in Donbas<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has unveiled his latest plan to bring peace to the war-torn eastern region of Donbas. And we're not talking about just any ordinary plan here. No, no. This one involves some serious A-list action.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (okay, it's actually just Volodymyr Zelensky speaking at a press conference), the Ukrainian president has proposed establishing a "free economic zone" in Donbas, which would essentially be a giant shopping mall where people can go and buy stuff without worrying about getting shot.<br/><br/>But that's not all. The plan also includes the involvement of none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who has apparently been recruited by Zelensky to help negotiate with Russian President Vladimir Putin. We're not sure what kind of leverage The Rock brings to the table (besides his incredible charm and charisma), but we're told it's all about creating a "safe space for negotiations."<br/><br/>Now, here's where things get really interesting. Apparently, the plan involves holding regular pizza parties in the Donbas region, where Ukrainian and Russian officials can come together and discuss their differences over a slice (or three) of pizza. Because, as we all know, there's no better way to resolve international conflicts than with a good pie.<br/><br/>According to Zelensky, the free economic zone would be policed by an international coalition of peacekeepers, including representatives from NATO, the European Union, and other interested parties. And just to make sure everyone knows who's boss, The Rock has been given a special role as "Head Pizza Maker" for the entire operation.<br/><br/>"We're not just talking about any ordinary free economic zone here," Zelensky said in a statement. "We're talking about a shopping paradise where people can come and buy all sorts of things without worrying about getting caught up in crossfire."<br/><br/>The plan has been met with skepticism by some, who point out that it's still unclear how a free economic zone would actually bring peace to the region. But Zelensky remains confident that his proposal will work wonders.<br/><br/>"We've got The Rock on board, we've got pizza parties planned, and we've got a shopping mall in Donbas," he said. "What more could you ask for?"<br/><br/>And there you have it, folks. The latest plan to end the war in Ukraine involves Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, pizza parties, and a free economic zone in Donbas. We'll be keeping an eye on this one...</p>
