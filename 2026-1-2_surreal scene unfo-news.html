        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Resort Fire Leaves 40 People Dead, Including a Teenage Golfer Named "Emanuele McFly"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a fire broke out at the Constellation Bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, killing 40 people and injuring 119 others. The victims included a teenage golfer named Emanuele McFly, who was feared dead after being spotted wearing a "Golf's My Game" t-shirt while trying to escape the inferno.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses described the scene as "chaotic," with people running around in their underwear, screaming for help and waving bottles of champagne. The fire was allegedly caused by sparklers attached to the bottles, which were lit by a group of partygoers who were trying to get into the holiday spirit.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a horror movie," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous. "I saw people jumping out of windows and running around like headless chickens. It was absolute pandemonium."<br/><br/>The fire was so intense that it melted the cheese fondue machines in the bar's kitchen, causing the patrons to panic even more.<br/><br/>As news of the tragedy spread, Swiss President Guy Parmelin rushed to the scene, wearing a somber expression and carrying a plate of raclette. "This is a terrible day for Switzerland," he said, trying to hold back tears. "I mean, who doesn't love a good raclette on New Year's Day?"<br/><br/>The Italian Golf Federation released a statement mourning the loss of Emanuele McFly, saying that he was a "young athlete with a passion for golf and a penchant for wearing sparkly socks."<br/><br/>In related news, French football club FC Metz announced that one of its youth players, Tahirys Dos Santos, had been severely burned in the fire. The player was airlifted to a hospital in Germany, where he is undergoing treatment.<br/><br/>As the investigation into the fire continues, authorities have promised to look into whether the bar met safety standards and had enough exits. They will also examine the use of fireproof materials, including a layer of foam that was applied to the ceiling for sound-proofing purposes.<br/><br/>In the meantime, the people of Crans-Montana are coming together to support the victims' families and to raise funds for a new fondue machine fund.<br/><br/>UPDATE: A helpline has been set up for concerned families: +41 848 112 117. Please note that this number is not affiliated with the Swiss phone company, but rather with a local pizza parlor that is offering free slices to callers who use this number.</p>
