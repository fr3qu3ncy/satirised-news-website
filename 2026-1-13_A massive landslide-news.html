        <p>RUBBISH LANDSLIDE DEATH TOLL IN PHILIPPINES RISES TO 11 (AND COUNTING)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Binaliw landfill in Cebu City has turned into a real-life game of "survival horror" - but instead of zombies, it's trash that's got everyone running for their lives. Yes, you read that right. Trash.<br/><br/>The landslide occurred while more than 100 workers were on site, which is just code for "a lot of people who probably shouldn't have been wearing bright yellow shirts". We're pretty sure the workers were not prepared for a mountain of rubbish to suddenly decide it was tired of being a mountain and just... collapse. It's like that one aunt at the family reunion - you never know when she'll just lose her temper (or in this case, her structural integrity).<br/><br/>Rescuers have so far pulled 12 injured people out of the debris, but more than 20 people still remain missing. We're not sure what's scarier: the thought of being trapped under a pile of garbage for three days or the fact that one local fire official mentioned it was "unlikely" for people to be alive after such a long time... which is just code for "we've given up hope, but let's keep searching anyway".<br/><br/>The incident has sparked calls for a review of the country's waste management system, mainly because it's clear that whoever managed this landfill needs to go back to trash-collecting school. Or maybe they should just be forced to watch an endless loop of cat videos made from actual garbage.<br/><br/>Environment authorities have since ordered Prime Integrated Waste Solutions, Inc., the landfill's operator, to suspend its activities at the site, which is just code for "you're fired... but don't worry, we'll give you a nice severance package and some company swag".<br/><br/>The company would have to "submit a compliance plan within 90 days", which is roughly the same amount of time it takes to watch an entire season of your favorite TV show. We're not sure what's more impressive: their ability to collapse a landfill or their commitment to filling out paperwork.<br/><br/>Lawmakers have called for reviews of the country's waste management system and working conditions of waste workers, mainly because they're trying to avoid getting blamed for this whole debacle. It's like that one friend who always tries to shift the blame when you find out they ate the last slice of pizza - "it was the cat, I swear!"<br/><br/>And finally, we have a quote from Bienvinido Ranido, whose wife worked at the landfill and is now unfortunately deceased: "The garbage exploded." Well, that's one way to put it. We're pretty sure he meant to say something more profound, but we'll just stick with the literal interpretation.<br/><br/>Update: Just got word that a team of highly trained professionals (aka Chuck Norris and his beard) has arrived at the scene to assist in the rescue efforts. They've been spotted taking down trash cans like they're ninjas on a mission from God. Stay tuned for further updates!</p>
