        <p>BREAKING: Eleven minutes of video capture the moment Bondi beach turns into a scene from "Zoolander"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Bondi Beach in Sydney, Australia has turned into a scene from the classic comedy film "Zoolander". BBC Verify has analysed dozens of videos from the attack and its aftermath, matching them up to map out the movements of the two gunmen, a heroic bystander, and the victims.<br/><br/>What began as a joyous event for the Jewish community celebrating the beginning of Hanukkah at Sydney's most iconic beach quickly turned into a horrific... wait, no. It turned into a scene from "Zoolander". That's right, folks! The usually tranquil Bondi Beach was suddenly filled with the sound of explosions, gunfire, and the unmistakable voice of Owen Wilson yelling "I'm really, really ridiculously good looking!"<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the two gunmen were seen walking onto the beach wearing nothing but their underwear and a pair of sunglasses. They were immediately spotted by the heroic bystander, who was busy taking selfies with his phone. The bystander, whose name is John, quickly jumped into action, using his impressive collection of ninja moves to take down one of the gunmen.<br/><br/>However, things took a turn for the worse when the second gunman pulled out a can of hairspray and used it as a makeshift flamethrower. The crowd gasped in shock as John was engulfed in flames, but somehow managed to survive by doing a backflip off the beach into the nearby ocean.<br/><br/>The victims, on the other hand, were all seen fleeing in terror as a giant inflatable unicorn suddenly appeared out of nowhere and began chasing them around the beach. It's not clear what caused the unicorn to appear, but eyewitnesses claim it was "totally unexpected" and "really, really ridiculously good looking".<br/><br/>As the situation continued to spiral out of control, the police arrived on the scene, only to be confronted by a group of heavily armed... wait for it... chickens. Yes, you read that right! The chickens, who were seen wearing tiny sunglasses and tutus, refused to back down and began pecking at the officers' shoes.<br/><br/>It's not clear what will happen next in this bizarre scenario, but one thing is certain: Bondi Beach will never be the same again.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Australian government has issued a statement assuring citizens that the situation is under control and that the country's supply of hairspray and inflatable unicorns is secure.</p>
