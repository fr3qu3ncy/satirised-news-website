        <p>US Lawmakers: "Hold My Beer, We're Not Paying for Hegseth's Travel Fund Until You Release That Video of the Boat Strike... with Unedited Footage, and a Chorus Line of Dancers"<br/><br/>In a bold move to pressure the Trump administration into releasing unedited video footage of a controversial military strike, US lawmakers have threatened to withhold travel funds from Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth's office. The move has left everyone in Washington scratching their heads, wondering if this is some kind of joke.<br/><br/>According to sources, the provision is buried deep within a 3,000-page defense spending policy bill that authorizes nearly $901 billion in funding for next year's military adventures. It appears that lawmakers have taken inspiration from the classic TV show "The Big Bang Theory" and decided to add their own spin on Sheldon Cooper's famous line: "Hold my beer, I'm going to make some changes."<br/><br/>In related news, sources close to the White House claim that President Trump has been spotted in the Oval Office watching a video of the infamous "double-tap" attack on a boat, repeatedly saying, "This is not a drill, folks. This is a Netflix series. Release the video and let's get this over with."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Defense Secretary Hegseth has been seen trying to justify the strikes by claiming that each of the alleged drug boats sunk had saved 25,000 American lives – which, when you think about it, is roughly equivalent to the number of pizzas delivered in America every hour. We're not sure what's more astonishing – the claim itself or the fact that nobody has asked him to produce evidence for this dubious statistic.<br/><br/>As lawmakers continue to debate the merits of withholding Hegseth's travel funds, we can't help but wonder if they've considered an even bolder move: replacing the travel budget with a fund to buy Hegseth a one-way ticket to a remote island where he can contemplate his actions while being serenaded by a chorus line of dancers.</p>
