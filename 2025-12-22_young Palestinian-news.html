        <p>A one-year-old girl named Siwar Ashour was returned to her home in Gaza after medical treatment in Jordan, but instead of a warm welcome, her family's attempt to navigate the local healthcare system descended into utter chaos, complete with arguments over who got to hold her first and a grandmother joking that she just needed Netflix.</p>

        <p>Breaking News: Baby's Return from Jordan Causes Chaos in Gaza<br/><br/>Gaza - In a shocking turn of events, one-year-old Siwar Ashour has been returned to her home in Gaza after completing her medical treatment in Jordan. But instead of being greeted with open arms and warm smiles, Siwar's family was met with confusion and chaos as they tried to navigate the complexities of Gaza's healthcare system.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Siwar's family was seen arguing with hospital staff over who got to hold her first - a scene that has been described as "utterly ridiculous" by onlookers. Meanwhile, Siwar herself seemed unbothered by the commotion, busy munching on a bag of Cheetos she had smuggled into Gaza from Jordan.<br/><br/>"It's like they forgot that she was only one years old and just wanted to go home and watch some cartoons," said Sahar Ashour, Siwar's grandmother. "I mean, who needs medical treatment when you have a reliable Netflix subscription?"<br/><br/>According to sources close to the hospital, Siwar was initially diagnosed with a bad case of the flu, but it quickly turned out to be a rare condition known as " Gaza-itis" - a disease caused by excessive exposure to Hamas propaganda and Israeli airstrikes.<br/><br/>As a result, doctors were forced to prescribe Siwar an experimental treatment involving repeated viewings of reruns of The Great British Baking Show. Sources claim that the treatment was successful in stabilizing Siwar's condition, but it has left her with a lingering addiction to soggy bottoms and perfectly floured pastry crusts.<br/><br/>In related news, Dr. Khalil al-Daqran, the head of al-Aqsa Martyrs Hospital, was seen sipping tea on his hospital balcony, muttering something about "humanitarian needs" and "staggering" this and that. When asked for comment, he simply shrugged and said, "What's a little diarrhoea when you're trying to negotiate with the Israeli government?"<br/><br/>The United Nations has since issued a statement expressing concern over the lack of international aid to Gaza, but it was quickly dismissed by Jordanian authorities who pointed out that they had already sent 45 other children back to Gaza, along with a shipment of slightly-used diapers and last season's catalogues from the IKEA store in Amman.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Siwar's family is trying to get her evacuated once more due to her condition - which has been described as "utterly dire" by medical experts. However, it seems that they may have already missed their chance, as Israel has imposed a new blockade on Gaza, prohibiting the entry of all formula milk and clothing with more than two layers.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, an Israeli government spokesperson simply shrugged and said, "Hey, someone's gotta keep those Palestinians from getting too comfortable."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story - or not.</p>
