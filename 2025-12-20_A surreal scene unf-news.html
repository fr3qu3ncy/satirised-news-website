        <p>Epstein Files Release Causes Chaos: Photos of Epstein's Properties, Audio Cassettes, and High-Profile Figures, Including Ozzy the Dog<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US Department of Justice has released thousands of files related to its investigations into the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. And by "shocking," we mean utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>The partial release includes images of Epstein's properties, which look suspiciously like a normal house with some extra security cameras and a few more locks on the doors than usual. Also included are photos of high-profile figures such as Bill Clinton and Michael Jackson, who are seen smiling and looking innocent, completely unaware that they're about to be thrust into a media frenzy.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The release also features audio files, which are described as " cryptic messages" from Epstein himself. Sources close to the investigation (okay, it was just a guy named Bob) say these messages are actually just Epstein rambling on about his favorite TV shows and how much he loves pineapple pizza.<br/><br/>And because we couldn't make this up if we tried, the release also includes footage of Luigi Mangione, who's seen being questioned by police while sitting in a chair at McDonald's. Because what's more suspenseful than a murder investigation set against the backdrop of a fast-food restaurant?<br/><br/>But the real star of the show is Ozzy the dog, whose tongue has been officially measured and certified as the longest canine tongue on record. We mean, who needs actual news when you can just focus on a dog with an absurdly long tongue?<br/><br/>And in related news, President Trump hosted the Kennedy Center Honors ceremony last week, where he was seen standing at a podium looking dignified and presidential, completely unaware that his name keeps getting dragged into every news article about Epstein.<br/><br/>In other news, Kilauea volcano has been erupting intermittently since December, which is just peachy for Hawaii. And if you're ever driving through Florida, just be sure to watch out for 600-pound alligators trying to cross the road.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The Epstein files release: where the most exciting news of the day involves a dog's tongue and a guy being questioned at McDonald's.</p>
