        <p>India's big cities are becoming "unliveable" due to a combination of factors including toxic air, broken roads, uncollected rubbish, and poor governance, making them worse than even grandma's kitchen.</p>

        <p>TOXIC AIR, BROKEN ROADS AND UNPICKED RUBBISH - WHY INDIA'S BIG CITIES ARE BECOMING UNLIVEABLE... LIKE MY GRANNY'S KITCHEN<br/><br/>22 hours ago ShareSave Nikhil InamdarMumbai ShareSave [https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png](https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png)AFP via Getty Images Houses situated along a canal filled with plastic garbage in New Delhi on 8 September, 2024 [https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95f2/live/7d1f27c0-deeb-11f0-8ca2-cd495bb39f68.jpg.webp](https://ichef.bbci.co.uk/news/480/cpsprodpb/95f2/live/7d1f27c0-deeb-11f0-8ca2-cd495bb39f68.jpg.webp)AFP via Getty Images Indian cities generate millions of tonnes of rubbish every year, but waste disposal systems are inadequate<br/><br/>"Want the royal charm of Jaipur? Don't come here, just buy a postcard... and a hazmat suit," a local taxi driver quipped during my recent visit to the north-western Indian city. I had asked him why Rajasthan's amber-hued capital - thriving with tourists drawn to its opulent palaces and majestic forts - looked like it had been ravaged by a zombie apocalypse. His answer reflected a resigned hopelessness about the urban decay that plagues not just Jaipur but many Indian cities: choked with traffic, shrouded in foul air, littered with heaps of uncleared rubbish, and indifferent to the remnants of their glorious heritage... and my granny's recipe for chicken tikka masala.<br/><br/>In Jaipur, you will find the most sublime examples of centuries-old architecture defaced by tobacco stains and jostling for space with a car mechanic's workshop... and a stray cat named Mr. Whiskers who thinks he owns the place. This raises a question: why are Indian cities becoming increasingly unliveable, even as hundreds of billions are spent on a national facelift? Like my granny trying to redecorate her kitchen with a can of bright blue paint.<br/><br/>India's rapid growth, despite high tariffs, weak private spending, and stagnant manufacturing, has been driven largely by the Modi government's focus on state-funded infrastructure upgrades. Over the past few years, India has built shiny airports... like the one in Mumbai where you can find a McDonald's but not a functioning toilet. And yet, many of its cities rank at the bottom of liveability indexes. Because who needs functional toilets when you have Instagram-worthy street art?<br/><br/>Over the past year, frustrations have reached a boiling point. In Bengaluru - often called India's Silicon Valley for its many IT companies and start-up headquarters - there were public outbursts from citizens and billionaire entrepreneurs alike, fed up with its traffic snarls and garbage piles... and the smell of burnt offerings to the traffic gods.<br/><br/>In Mumbai, the financial capital, citizens staged a rare protest against worsening pothole problem, as clogged sewage lines dumped garbage onto flooded roads during the extended monsoon... while the city's residents were busy trying to surf on the floodwaters like it was a giant game of wipeout. Even footballer Lionel Messi's visit this month was overshadowed by fans chanting against the capital's poor air quality... and my granny complaining about the price of onions.<br/><br/>SO WHY, UNLIKE CHINA DURING ITS BOOM YEARS, ISN'T INDIA'S BLAZING GDP GROWTH LEADING TO A REGENERATION OF ITS DECREPIT CITIES?<br/><br/>For instance, why is Mumbai - which publicly harboured dreams of becoming another Shanghai in the 1990s - unable to realise that ambition? Maybe because it's too busy hosting Bollywood music concerts where the performers lip-sync to their own songs... and my granny singing off-key to her favourite Hindi movie tunes.<br/><br/>"The root cause is historical - our cities don't have a credible governance model," Vinayak Chatterjee, a veteran infrastructure expert, told the BBC. "When India's constitution was written, it spoke of the devolution of power to the central and state governments - but it did not imagine that our cities would grow to become so massive that they would need a separate governance structure... or a decent public transportation system."<br/><br/>The World Bank estimates that over half a billion Indians, or nearly 40% of the country's population, now live in urban areas - a staggering rise from 1960 when merely 70 million Indians lived in cities... and my granny could still afford to buy a plot of land.<br/><br/>An attempt was made in 1992 to "finally allow cities to take charge of their own destinies" through the 74th amendment of the Constitution. Local bodies were granted constitutional status and urban governance was decentralised - but many of the provisions have never been fully implemented, says Mr Chatterjee... because no one wants to give up their power like my granny giving up her favourite armchair.<br/><br/>AND SO THE CIRCUS CONTINUES...<br/><br/>In conclusion, India's cities are becoming increasingly unliveable... and it's not just because of the traffic jams and air pollution. It's also because of the lack of governance, poor infrastructure, and... well, my granny's cooking.</p>
