        <h2>DONALD TRUMP SAVES NATO FROM ITSELF</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>NATO's increased spending pledge is somehow being hailed as Donald Trump's biggest foreign policy success, despite him once calling NATO a "joke".</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="article">
        <p>NATO SPENDING PLEDGE IS TRUMP'S BIGGEST FOREIGN POLICY SUCCESS, RUTTE TELLS BBC<br/><br/>Well, isn't this just peachy? In a shocking turn of events, the Nato chief has come out and said that it's all thanks to Donald Trump that the alliance is "stronger than it ever was". Yes, you read that right. The same Donald Trump who thinks NATO is a "joke" and that we should be paying them for their protection.<br/><br/>I mean, who needs actual military strength when you have a good sales pitch? Mark Rutte, the Nato chief, told the BBC that Trump's efforts to get European allies to cough up more cash for defense was the key to NATO's newfound "strength". Because, clearly, what we really needed was a billionaire with a bad comb-over telling us how to do our jobs.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the part where Trump threatened to withdraw US protection if Europe didn't shape up and start paying their fair share. That's just classic Trump - using bullying tactics to get what he wants, while simultaneously taking credit for someone else's work.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Rutte also praised Trump's efforts to find a peaceful solution to the war in Ukraine. Yeah, because nothing says "peace" like a draft of a peace plan that favors Russia. I'm sure the Ukrainians are just thrilled to have their country carved up and handed over to the Russians on a silver platter.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on Putin's response to all this. He dismissed the whole thing as "hysteria", because what else would he say? "Oh, yeah, I'm totally planning on invading Europe within the next five years"? Please. That's just not how diplomacy works... or does it?<br/><br/>In related news, the UK's Royal Navy has been spotted shadowing a Russian submarine through the English Channel. Because, you know, that's exactly what we need - more NATO countries trying to protect themselves from Russia's military might.<br/><br/>And just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder, we have the US offering Ukraine "strong" security guarantees... but still refusing to give them back their territory. Because, apparently, that's just not something we can do for our allies these days. I mean, who needs actual border control when you can just promise to be nice and hope for the best?<br/><br/>All in all, it's been a wild ride watching NATO try to figure out how to deal with Russia's aggressive behavior. But hey, at least they're trying... or so they claim.<br/><br/>In other news<br/><br/>* Putin has warned that Russia is ready to "fight now" if Europe wants to start a war. Because what's a little threat of global conflict without some good old-fashioned saber-rattling?<br/>* The EU is considering using frozen Russian assets to fund Ukraine's military and economic needs. Which, I'm sure, will totally not be a recipe for disaster.<br/>* And finally, the UK and France have moved to revive voluntary military service for 18-year-olds. Because nothing says "strong military" like drafting teenagers into a war zone.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling saga!</p>
