        <p>EUROVISION WINNER NEMO TO RETURN TROPHY IN PROTEST AT ISRAEL, BUT NOT BEFORE THEY HAVE A PIZZA PARTY WITH THE KARDASHIANS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Swiss singer and Eurovision winner Nemo has announced that they will be returning their trophy in protest over Israel's continued participation in the event. But before they do that, they're going to have a pizza party with the Kardashians.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation, Nemo was feeling a little "hangry" after hearing about the Israeli government's attempt to influence the public vote, and thought it would be a great idea to invite Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, Kylie, and Kendall over for a slice (or three). The party is rumored to feature a special guest appearance by Lemmy from Motörhead, who will be performing an impromptu set on his favorite instrument - the air guitar.<br/><br/>"I just wanted to have a fun night with my friends," said Nemo in a statement. "But then I remembered that Israel is still participating in Eurovision, and suddenly the pizza didn't seem so important anymore."<br/><br/>The 26-year-old singer went on to explain that they felt there was a clear conflict between Israel's involvement in the competition and the ideals of unity, inclusion, and dignity that the contest says it stands for. "I mean, come on," said Nemo. "If we can't even get a decent pizza party without having to worry about Israeli politicians trying to rig the vote, then what's the point of it all?"<br/><br/>Martin Green, director of the Eurovision Song Contest, was quick to respond to Nemo's announcement, saying that they were "saddened" by the decision and respected Nemo's views. "But can we still have a group chat with the Kardashians?" asked Green in a follow-up statement.<br/><br/>Israel's President Isaac Herzog has praised the decision to allow the country to compete, calling it an "appreciated gesture of solidarity, brotherhood, and co-operation". When asked for comment, he simply replied, "Can I get a slice of pizza?"<br/><br/>The boycotts and protests over Israel's inclusion have been the biggest crisis Eurovision has ever seen. This year's competition also had a voting controversy and allegations that Israel's government tried to influence the public vote. Next year's event is due to take place in Vienna, but it remains to be seen whether Nemo will still be there to collect their trophy.<br/><br/>As one source close to the situation put it, "It's not like they didn't have a great song or anything... I mean, 'The Code' was a real earworm. But hey, maybe they can just write a new song about how much they hate Israel's participation in Eurovision."<br/><br/>In related news, the producers of Eurovision have announced that they will be introducing a new category for "Best Use of Air Guitar" in an attempt to lure Lemmy back onto the stage.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>We've just received word that Nemo has changed their mind and is now planning on returning the trophy in person. However, due to a last-minute scheduling conflict with Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's new Netflix special, they will be unable to attend the event themselves.<br/><br/>Instead, they have appointed a team of highly trained ninja warriors to carry out the task on their behalf. The ninjas are rumored to be wearing matching pink ruffled jackets and are said to be armed with nothing but a pair of fluffy slippers and a stern look.<br/><br/>"It's going to be a real spectacle," said one eyewitness. "I mean, who needs actual controversy when you can have ninja-wielding Swiss singers returning trophies in protest?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
