        <p>COMEDY EDITION<br/><br/>BREAKING NEWS: Russian Attack on Kyiv Shows Moscow "Totally Lost the Plot" Says Zelensky<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russia launched a 10-hour missile and drone barrage at Ukraine's capital, killing two people and injuring 32. But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom! Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky took to Telegram to say that the attack showed Moscow "doesn't want peace"... and by that, he meant they just really love playing a game of "Dodgeball with Drones".<br/><br/>As the attack raged on, BBC journalist Anastasiya Gribanova was in her apartment building elevator when it got hit. She emerged unscathed, but her high-rise home was left looking like it had been put through a blender by a group of overzealous interior designers.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get some coffee," said Gribanova, "when suddenly I heard the sound of gunfire and blasts. I thought it was just the neighbors having a rave party again."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russia's Defence Ministry claimed that their air defence systems had intercepted and destroyed almost 200 Ukrainian drones over several Russian regions. But when asked for comment, they just shrugged and said, "Oh, you know, just another Tuesday".<br/><br/>In other news, Polish fighter jets were put on high alert as the country prepared to defend its airspace from the incoming Russian missiles. However, it was later revealed that they were actually just practicing their best aerobics moves.<br/><br/>The attack also left 40% of residential buildings in Kyiv and nearby districts without heating. But don't worry, residents were advised to just bundle up and pretend it's the 1970s again.<br/><br/>As for Vladimir Putin, he visited a command and control overseeing Moscow's war while wearing army fatigues. Because, you know, that's exactly what you wear to a war – your best Sunday brunch outfit.<br/><br/>The new 20-point draft peace plan agreed by American and Ukrainian envoys includes security guarantees from the US, Nato, and European allies for a co-ordinated military response if Russia were to invade Ukraine again. But let's be real, it's just a fancy way of saying "we're going to bomb you into oblivion if you don't behave".<br/><br/>The draft reportedly includes control of Ukraine's eastern Donbas as an option, which is code for "we're going to make the Russians pay for their ridiculous mustaches".<br/><br/>And finally, Donald Trump told Politico that he was expecting to see the new draft on Sunday and thought it would be a great idea to invite Putin over for some nice tea and crumpets. Because nothing says "diplomacy" like a game of "Pin the Tail on the Bear".<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this totally-not-serious situation!</p>
