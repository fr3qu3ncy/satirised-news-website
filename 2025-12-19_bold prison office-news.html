        <p>BREAKING: Ugandan Law Requires Public Servants to Remain Politically Neutral, Unless You're a Sassy Prison Officer<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the government of Uganda has finally figured out that public servants can't just go around being all sassy on TikTok. Lawrence Ampe, a prison officer with a penchant for using social media to expose corruption and abuse of power, was summarily sacked from his job after he refused to take down his incendiary videos.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Prisons Council (which sounds like an actual thing in Uganda), Ampe's dismissal letter stated that "the standing orders don't allow a public officer to participate in politics, which he is doing even now." In other words, Lawrence was basically told to shut up and go back to his regular job of locking people up.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better. Bobi Wine, the pop star-turned-politician who's running against President Yoweri Museveni (who's been in power for nearly 40 years), defended Ampe's actions and accused the government of double standards. "Why are they always picking on Lawrence?" he asked. "Can't they see that he's just trying to expose corruption and abuse of power?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ampe himself has been making waves on TikTok with his signature flair for the dramatic. In a video uploaded just yesterday, he urged Ugandans not to worry about how he would survive without a job, saying "What we are doing is not all about money but about liberating our nation." We're pretty sure that's code for "I'll be fine, guys."<br/><br/>And if you thought this was the end of the story, think again! The opposition in Uganda has condemned Ampe's dismissal as evidence of "systemic oppression" and double standards within the security sector. "This is just another example of how the government is trying to silence anyone who dares to speak out against them," said a spokesperson for the opposition.<br/><br/>So, there you have it folks! Another day in the life of Uganda, where public servants can't even get away with being mildly subversive on social media without getting sacked. Next thing you know, they'll be trying to shut down Netflix because someone's been binge-watching too much "House of Cards."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the thrilling world of Ugandan politics!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: Lawrence Ampe has since updated his TikTok bio to read "Former Prison Officer & Freedom Fighter." Good luck with that, Lawrence.</p>
