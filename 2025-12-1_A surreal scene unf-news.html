        <p>**BREAKING: Putin Prepares for Meeting with Trump's Son-in-Law and a Surprise Guest - Elvis Presley**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Vladimir Putin has announced that he will be meeting with US envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner on Tuesday. But what makes this meeting truly unique is the surprise guest who will be joining them - none other than the King of Rock 'n' Roll himself, Elvis Presley.<br/><br/>Sources close to the Kremlin confirm that Putin has been practicing his dance moves in preparation for Elvis's arrival. "We've got a special playlist ready," said a spokesperson. "It includes all of Elvis's greatest hits, including 'Hound Dog', 'Jailhouse Rock', and 'Love Me Tender'."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Witkoff and Kushner are reportedly frantically trying to figure out how to incorporate Elvis into the peace talks. "We're not sure if we should have him sing 'Can't Help Falling in Love' or 'Burnin' Love'," said a source. "But one thing's for sure - Putin will be tapping his foot along with the beat."<br/><br/>As tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to simmer, some are questioning whether Elvis's presence is just a distraction from the real issues at hand. "Is this really what we need right now?" asked Ukrainian President Zelensky in a statement. "I mean, I'm all for peace and love, but can't we focus on finding a solution to this conflict instead of breaking out into choreographed dance numbers?"<br/><br/>Despite the controversy surrounding Elvis's involvement, Putin remains undeterred. "We're going to make peace great again," he vowed. "And if that means getting down to some funky tunes with Elvis, then so be it."<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** The White House has just released a statement confirming that Elvis will indeed be attending the meeting and performing a special rendition of his hit song "Blue Hawaii". It's rumored that Putin has promised not to interrupt Elvis during his performance, but only time will tell.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>As tensions between Russia and Ukraine continue to escalate, one thing is clear - this conflict is no laughing matter. But amidst all the seriousness, there's something undeniably funny about Elvis Presley being brought in as a last-minute peacekeeper.<br/><br/>And let's be real, if anyone can bring people together with his dance moves and catchy tunes, it's the King himself. So here's to Elvis - may he bring a little bit of joy and levity to this otherwise dire situation.<br/><br/>**Related Stories:**<br/><br/>* "Elvis Presley to Join Peace Talks Between Russia and Ukraine"<br/>* "Putin Practices Dance Moves in Preparation for Elvis's Arrival"<br/>* "Ukraine's President Zelensky Expresses Concern Over Elvis's Involvement"<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
