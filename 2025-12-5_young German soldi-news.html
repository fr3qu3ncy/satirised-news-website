    <div class="summery">
        <p>In a bizarre move, Germany has introduced voluntary military service plans that require 18-year-old men to have at least 5,000 Instagram followers and a Justin Bieber-style hair flip in order to join what's now essentially a boy band army.</p>

        <p>GERMANY TURNS ITS MILITARY INTO A BOY BAND: VOLUNTARY SERVICE PLANS HOPING TO RECRUIT ENOUGH YOUNG MEN TO FORM EUROPE'S STRONGEST CONVENTIONAL ARMY... AND JUSTIN BIEBER AS ITS NEW DEFENCE MINISTER<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Germany has voted to introduce voluntary military service for 18-year-olds, but with a twist: all recruits will be required to have a minimum of 5,000 Instagram followers and a Justin Bieber-style hair flip. The aim is to create Europe's strongest conventional army, but it seems the real goal is to recruit enough young men to form a boy band.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Defence Ministry, Chancellor Friedrich Merz has been secretly meeting with talent scouts from "The X Factor" to select the most promising young recruits for the new military service. "We're not just looking for soldiers," said Merz. "We're looking for the next big thing in pop music."<br/><br/>As part of the program, all 18-year-old men will be sent a questionnaire asking if they are interested and willing to join the armed forces... or become a backup dancer for the new German boy band. The form will be mandatory for men with six-pack abs, but voluntary for those who can only grow a decent beard.<br/><br/>Students at schools across Germany have said they will join strikes in as many as 90 cities on Friday to protest against the move, carrying signs that read "I don't want to spend half a year of my life locked up in barracks... with Justin Bieber's hairdresser".<br/><br/>In Hamburg alone, about 1,500 people were expected to join the protests, and school head teachers warned parents not to take their children out of school for the day... or they might just end up as backup dancers.<br/><br/>Germany's Defence Minister Boris Pistorius said that military service will be voluntary for as long as possible, but from July 2027, all 18-year-old men will have to take a medical exam to assess their fitness for possible military service... and their ability to perform a flawless moonwalk in front of Justin Bieber.<br/><br/>The long-term aim is to raise the number of troops by the early 2030s to 260,000, supplemented by approximately 200,000 reservists who can all sing along to "Sorry" on demand. If war were to break out, the military would be able to draw on the questionnaires and medical exams for potential recruits... and a backup dance crew.<br/><br/>GERMANY AGREES NEW MILITARY SERVICE PLAN TO BOOST TROOP NUMBERS... AND JUSTIN BIEBER'S CAREER<br/><br/>In related news, Justin Bieber has been spotted at the German Defence Ministry, meeting with high-ranking officials to discuss his new role as Defence Minister. "I'm thrilled to be joining the team," said Bieber. "And I'm pretty sure I can teach these guys a thing or two about being 'Sorry'... I mean, sorry for not doing their military service."<br/><br/>Sources close to the Ministry have confirmed that Bieber will be leading a special task force of troops who are trained in the art of singing and dancing. "It's going to be huge," said one source. "We're talking world domination through pop music."<br/><br/>The new military service plan has been met with widespread approval from Germany's military leaders, who see it as an opportunity to boost troop numbers... and Justin Bieber's bank account.<br/><br/>GERMANY INTRODUCES NEW MILITARY SERVICE PLAN: ALL RECRUITS MUST HAVE 5,000 INSTAGRAM FOLLOWERS AND A JUSTIN BIEBER-STYLE HAIR FLIP<br/><br/>The new plan has been praised by international leaders, who see it as a bold move to create Europe's strongest conventional army... and a pop sensation that will be remembered for generations to come.<br/><br/>Justin Bieber has already begun recruiting troops, posting on social media: "Who wants to join the new German boy band? DM me!"<br/><br/>GERMANY'S DEFENCE MINISTER SAYS VOLUNTARY MILITARY SERVICE WILL BE A SUCCESS... AS LONG AS RECRUITS CAN PERFORM A FLAWLESS MOONWALK<br/><br/>The Defence Ministry has confirmed that the new plan will be a huge success, as long as recruits can perform a flawless moonwalk. "It's going to be a game-changer," said Minister Pistorius. "We're not just building an army... we're building a pop empire."<br/><br/>Germany's Chancellor Friedrich Merz has welcomed the news, saying: "This is exactly what we needed to take our military service to the next level... and create a new boy band that will be remembered for generations to come."</p>
