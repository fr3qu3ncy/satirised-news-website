        <p>BREAKING: Australian Government Enacts Social Media Ban for Kids, Meta Blocks 550,000 Accounts<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Australian government has enacted a law that prohibits kids from using social media. That's right, folks! No more Instagram selfies, Facebook posts, or Twitter rants for Aussie youngsters under the age of 16.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Meta, the company behind Facebook and Instagram, has responded to this draconian measure by... blocking 550,000 accounts. Yes, you read that right – they're not just complying with the law; they're taking a proactive approach to protecting kids from themselves!<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (aka a reliable Google search), Meta's CEO, Mark Zuckerberg, was overheard saying, "You know what? I'm all for this social media ban. Who needs kids on social media, anyway? It's not like they're going to use it to learn new things or connect with friends. Nope, let's just keep them locked away in a digital cage where they can't possibly get into any trouble... or be cool."<br/><br/>As the news spread like wildfire (or rather, like a well-crafted meme), parents across Australia were seen rejoicing in their living rooms, shouting, "We told you so!" while simultaneously thinking, "How are we going to keep our kids entertained now?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts have weighed in on the matter, with some predicting that this move will only lead to an increase in underground social media networks for kids. Think of it like the Wild West, but with more selfies and less law enforcement.<br/><br/>"It's a slippery slope," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in child development (or at least, someone who knows how to Google). "First, they ban social media; next thing you know, they'll be banning video games, then TV, and before we know it, kids will be stuck playing with dolls and listening to classical music for entertainment."<br/><br/>The Australian government has responded to these concerns by saying, "Don't worry, we've got this under control. We're working on a top-secret project called 'Kid-Friendly Social Media' that will allow young people to safely interact online... using a special app that only allows them to post pictures of puppies and kittens."<br/><br/>In related news, the stock market has plummeted due to Meta's decision to block all accounts younger than 16. Investors are panicking, wondering how they'll make their millions from ad revenue now.<br/><br/>So there you have it – Australia's bold move to protect kids from social media, Meta's bold response to block 550,000 accounts, and the world's collective shrug of indifference. What's next?</p>
