        <p>BREAKING: Hamas Commander Killed in Gaza Strike, Israel Blamed (Sort Of)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Raed Saad, the senior commander of Hamas' Qassam Brigades, was killed in a strike on his car in Gaza City. Or, as we like to call it, "That One Time the Israelis Just Happened to Kill a Guy in His Car Again."<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (i.e., the guy who was driving behind him), Saad's car was parked near a small café where Barbra Streisand was performing an impromptu concert. Witnesses claim that just as Babs finished her rendition of "You Don't Bring Me Flowers," a blast rocked the area, killing Saad and three others. We're pretty sure it had nothing to do with the fact that he was wearing a "I Hamas" t-shirt.<br/><br/>The Israeli military quickly issued a statement denying any involvement in the incident, claiming that they were just "trying to get a good spot at the café for the concert." However, sources close to the investigation (okay, we just asked our buddy Avi who works at the IDF) revealed that an anonymous tip had been called in about Saad's car being suspiciously parked near the café.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hamas officials are pointing fingers and accusing Israel of "yet another heinous act of terrorism." We're pretty sure they mean it this time. In fact, we've just received word that a group of Hamas militants have taken over the Gaza Strip's only IKEA store in protest. Yes, you read that right – IKEA.<br/><br/>BREAKING UPDATE: Just as we were about to publish this article, a source close to the White House (okay, it was our cousin Larry who works at the State Department) informed us that President Trump is "totally unaware" of any Israeli involvement in Saad's killing. When asked for comment, Trump tweeted: "Just learned about the Gaza thing. Sad! So sad. Not my problem, though."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY (OR NOT)</p>
