        <p>UKRAINE'S LEADER GETS EXCITED ABOUT PEACE PLAN, INVOLVES MICKEY MOUSE AND DONALD TRUMP IN TOP-SECRET MEETINGS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has emerged from top-secret meetings with US envoys Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner with an upbeat assessment of their progress towards ending the Russia-Ukraine war. And by "shocking," we mean utterly bizarre.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the president, Zelensky's enthusiasm for peace was fueled in part by Witkoff's impressive collection of novelty socks, which he proudly displayed during the meetings. "Steve's got some amazing Christmas socks, folks!" exclaimed Zelensky, who went on to reveal that he had asked Witkoff and Kushner to pass along holiday greetings to US President Donald Trump... and his entire family... including his hair stylist.<br/><br/>The talks between the two envoys and Zelensky reportedly lasted nearly an hour, during which time they discussed everything from the finer points of demilitarized zones to the optimal timing for a peace treaty. And, in a stunning turn of events, Mickey Mouse suddenly appeared at the negotiations, sporting a Ukrainian army uniform and offering his services as a mediator.<br/><br/>"I mean, who better to help us find peace than the leader of the world's most beloved mouse?" asked Zelensky, beaming with pride. "And let me tell you, folks, that guy can negotiate like nobody's business! I'm telling you, it was like watching a Disney movie come to life right before my eyes."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump tweeted his support for the peace talks, claiming that he had personally brokered the deal and that Mickey Mouse was simply a "wonderful" addition to the negotiations. "Just had the best phone call with Volodymyr Zelensky," tweeted The Donald. "He's got some great ideas on how to make Ukraine great again, believe me."<br/><br/>As for the Kremlin, they remained characteristically stoic, releasing a statement that merely acknowledged receipt of the proposals brought back by Russian envoy Kirill Dmitriev. "We are analyzing these materials and will continue our communication with the Americans," said Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov, trying not to roll his eyes too hard.<br/><br/>And in related news, the Ukrainian military reported a successful strike on one of Russia's key oil refineries using cruise missiles... which were somehow piloted by a team of highly trained (and secretly gay) accountants from Miami. "It was a real 'Mission Impossible'-style operation," said General Petro Poroshenko, puffing out his chest. "And let me tell you, those accountants were like a team of superheroes! They flew in, launched the missiles, and then flew back to their office building without anyone even noticing."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, folks!</p>
