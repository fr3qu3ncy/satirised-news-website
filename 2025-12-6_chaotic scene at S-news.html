        <h2>BREAKING: Passengers Evacuated from Burning Plane, Still Ask for Free Wi-Fi!</h2>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Passengers being evacuated from an airplane at São Paulo Airport due to a tarmac fire were still able to ask for free Wi-Fi and complained about the inconvenience, because clearly that's more important than their safety.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Equipment on Tarmac Catches Fire at São Paulo Airport, Passengers Forced to Evacuate... But Not Before Asking for Free Wi-Fi<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left officials scratching their heads, equipment on the tarmac at Brazil's São Paulo airport caught fire yesterday evening. But what's even more surprising is that passengers on board the Latam Airlines flight were forced to evacuate the plane while simultaneously asking for free Wi-Fi.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, flames and thick smoke engulfed the aircraft as it stood on the runway, prompting emergency personnel to rush to the scene. But as passengers were being evacuated, many of them couldn't resist asking airport staff if they could get a complimentary Wi-Fi code to watch Netflix while waiting for their flight to be rescheduled.<br/><br/>"It was like, 'Sorry folks, we're going to have to ask you to leave the plane now,' and then someone in the back would shout out, 'Can I still get my free hour of browsing?'" said one passenger, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, priorities, right?"<br/><br/>The fire on the tarmac was later brought under control with no injuries reported among the 169 passengers evacuated from the plane. However, officials are still trying to determine the cause of the blaze.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Latam Airlines has apologized for any inconvenience caused and offered all passengers a complimentary upgrade to their next flight – as long as they agree to watch a 10-minute video on "Airport Etiquette" before boarding.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Passengers Take Airport Staff to Task Over Wi-Fi Woes<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, passengers have taken to social media to vent their frustrations over not being able to access the internet while waiting for their flight to be rescheduled. Some have even started a Change.org petition demanding that airports provide free Wi-Fi for all passengers – at least until their next appointment.<br/><br/>"We're still trying to figure out what happened," said a spokesperson for the airport, "but in the meantime, we're doing our best to make sure everyone has access to... well, you know."<br/><br/>And so, as the people of São Paulo continue to deal with the aftermath of the fire, one thing is clear: priorities will always be paramount – even when faced with a raging inferno.</p>
