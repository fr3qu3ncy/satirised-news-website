        <p>"Sudan Slams Uganda for Hosting RSF Boss: 'A Threat to Humanity, Not a Brunch Invitation'"<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the international community scratching its head, Sudan's government has accused Uganda of flouting international law by hosting Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo, the leader of the Rapid Support Forces (RSF), also known as the "Sudanese Taliban." And to make matters even more confusing, sources close to the RSF have revealed that Dagalo was served a plate of his favorite dish, Injera and Sambusa, during the meeting.<br/><br/>The Sudanese government's statement read: "We condemn in the strongest terms the Ugandan government's reception of rebel leader Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo. This is not only an affront to humanity but also a serious breach of diplomatic protocol. We demand an explanation for why they didn't invite us to join them for lunch – I mean, who doesn't love Injera and Sambusa?"<br/><br/>President Museveni of Uganda has come under fire for hosting Dagalo, with many calling it a "clear case of 'Taliban-itis.'" When asked about the controversy, President Museveni shrugged and said, "Hey, I'm just trying to bring people together. If that means sharing some Sambusas, so be it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the RSF has taken to social media to defend their leader's actions, posting a series of Instagram stories featuring Dagalo enjoying his favorite snacks while simultaneously threatening to kill anyone who opposes him.<br/><br/>In related news, the United Nations has announced plans to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the growing threat of Injera and Sambusa-themed diplomatic incidents. "We urge all nations to exercise extreme caution when serving or consuming these dishes," said a spokesperson for the UN. "The consequences could be... well, let's just say 'unpredictable'."<br/><br/>As tensions continue to escalate, experts are warning that this incident may have far-reaching implications for global stability – and the snack food industry.</p>
