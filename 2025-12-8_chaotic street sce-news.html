        <p>A heated argument over who ate the last pizza in Thailand escalated into a 40-day conflict killing over 100 people and sparked a war of words between the countries' leaders over whose sovereignty is more important, the people's or their pizza rights.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: At least five people have been killed in the most serious confrontation between both sides since July, and it's all because of a silly argument over who ate the last pizza in Thailand.<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, thousands of residents on both sides of the Thai-Cambodian border fled their homes in droves yesterday as fresh clashes erupted, killing at least five people. But what really sparked this chaos was a heated debate between two neighbors, Somsak and Chong, over who ate the last pizza from the local convenience store.<br/><br/>"It all started when I noticed that my friend Chong had eaten the last slice of pizza," said Siksaka Pongsuwan, a resident on the Thai side of the border. "I mean, I love pizza as much as the next guy, but come on! It's like he stole it right from under my nose!"<br/><br/>And so, with tensions running high, Chong allegedly took to Facebook Live to confess his crime and claim that he was just trying to satisfy his cravings after a long day of dodging landmines in the disputed border area.<br/><br/>But Somsak wouldn't let it go, posting scathing messages on social media and organizing a group of angry villagers to protest against Chong's alleged pizza snatching. "It's not just about the pizza," he said. "It's about principle. If we don't stand up for what's right, then who will?"<br/><br/>As the situation escalated, both sides accused each other of starting the violence, which is now in its 40th day and has resulted in more than 100 deaths. Thailand's Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul chimed in, saying that his country "never wanted violence" but would "use necessary means to preserve its sovereignty"...and by that, he meant, of course, their pizza rights.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Cambodia's former leader Hun Sen took to Twitter to accuse Thai "invaders" of provoking retaliation...mainly because, let's be real, it was those pesky Thais who always hogged the good pizza places in the area.</p>
