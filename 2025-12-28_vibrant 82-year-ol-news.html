        <p>MULATU ASTATKE: THE GODFATHER OF ETHIOPIAN JAZZ CALLS IT QUITS (BUT NOT BEFORE PLAYING SOME SWEET GROOVES WITH ELTON JOHN)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the legendary Mulatu Astatke has announced that he's hanging up his vibraphone for good. But before he bid adieu to his international fans, the 82-year-old jazz maestro treated them to one final concert that was so hot, it would've melted the polar ice caps.<br/><br/>The show, which took place in a packed London venue, featured Mulatu and his band of merry musicians jamming together like it was 1969 all over again. But just as things were getting underway, a surprise guest appeared on stage: Elton John, resplendent in a sparkly jumpsuit and sporting a haircut that would make even the most seasoned mullet enthusiast proud.<br/><br/>The Rocket Man himself launched into an impromptu rendition of "Crocodile Rock," complete with jazz hands and a few strategically-placed dance moves that left the audience gasping for air. Mulatu, meanwhile, was overheard muttering something about needing to go get his teeth fixed after that kind of musical onslaught.<br/><br/>But once Elton had departed (leaving behind a trail of glitter and destroyed eardrums), Mulatu and his band got back to business, delivering a setlist that would make even the most jaded jazz aficionado weak in the knees. It was like they'd been transported back in time to the "Swinging Addis" era of the 1960s, when Ethiopian jazz was all the rage and everyone who was anyone was playing at the local club.<br/><br/>Of course, there were also some nods to Mulatu's more recent fame – a few choice bits from his work on the Broken Flowers soundtrack, for instance, which had the crowd singing along in no time. But overall, it was clear that this was a farewell concert done with style and panache, rather than as some sort of sad, nostalgia-tinged affair.<br/><br/>As Mulatu took his final bow (after a rousing encore performance of "Take Five," naturally), the audience erupted into applause, cheering and whistling for what felt like an eternity. It was clear that they'd all had the time of their lives, and that this concert would go down in history as one of the greatest jazz performances of all time.<br/><br/>And so, with a final flourish and a heartfelt "thank you" to his fans, Mulatu Astatke bid adieu to the stage, leaving behind a legacy that will be remembered for generations to come. Long live the Godfather of Ethiopian Jazz – may your vibraphone always sound sweet!<br/><br/>PHOTO CAPTION<br/><br/>Mulatu Astatke (center) and Elton John (right) share a laugh on stage during the legendary jazz musician's final concert in London.<br/><br/>(P.S. If you're wondering what happened to Mulatu's teeth, don't worry – it was just a bit of dental drama that had nothing to do with Elton's performance... or so we're told.)</p>
