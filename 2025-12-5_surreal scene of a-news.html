        <p>The Admiral Who Gave the Order for a Second Strike on an Alleged Drug Boat Briefed Lawmakers about the Incident, as the Military Confirmed Another Attack<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, US Navy Admiral Frank Bradley testified to lawmakers that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth did not give the order to "kill them all" during a second US military strike on an alleged drug boat in the Caribbean. Because, you know, who wouldn't want to give such an order? (Source: The Onion)<br/><br/>Lawmakers were seen nodding off during the testimony, only to wake up with a start when they realized they had been there for hours, still wondering what had happened to their lunch. It was later revealed that the Admiral's briefing was interrupted by a group of dolphins who swam into the room, distracting everyone and causing chaos.<br/><br/>Multiple lawmakers have said that Adm Bradley's testimony left them with more questions than answers, mainly because they were too busy trying to figure out why there were dolphins in the room. "I mean, what do you say when faced with the unexpected presence of marine mammals?" asked Representative Adam Smith. "Do we ignore it and hope for the best, or do we just start flapping our arms and shouting 'Cthulhu!'?"<br/><br/>The military confirmed another attack on an alleged drug boat in the eastern Pacific Ocean, at Hegseth's direction, because apparently someone thought that would be a good idea. It was later revealed that the survivors of the first strike were trying to climb back onto the boat to salvage their snacks, and not to flip it over so they could stay in the fight, as previously claimed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Representative Jim Himes was seen walking out of the briefing room, muttering to himself about how he had respected Adm Bradley until now. "Respect? Respect?! He's an admiral! He should be on a cereal box!" When asked for comment, Himes just shook his head and said, "I'm still trying to process why dolphins were in the room."<br/><br/>Breaking News<br/><br/>The US military has announced that it will henceforth include dolphins in all future briefings as a way to keep lawmakers awake. "It's a win-win," said a spokesperson. "We get to provide more realistic training for our personnel, and they get to learn how to deal with unexpected marine life."<br/><br/>In other news, the White House has announced that it will be hosting an intergalactic press conference next week to address allegations of alien life forms being present on US soil. When asked for comment, President Trump just shook his head and said, "Fake news, folks. Believe me, no one knows more about aliens than I do."</p>
