        <p>Breaking News: Lawmakers Unanimously Pass Bill Demanding Apology and Reparations from France for Colonial Crimes<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Algerian parliament has unanimously passed a law declaring France's colonialisation of Algeria a crime against humanity, while demanding an apology and reparations. Yes, you read that right - reparations! Because, let's be real, who doesn't love getting some cash back from their ancestors for all those pesky colonial wars?<br/><br/>Lawmakers were seen wearing scarves in the colors of the national flag, chanting "Long live Algeria!" as they passed the bill. We're not sure what's more impressive - their ability to pass a law or their synchronized scarf-wearing skills.<br/><br/>According to sources, the legislation states that France has "legal responsibility" for the "tragedies it caused", and "full and fair" compensation was an "inalienable right of the Algerian state and people". Because, clearly, nothing says "inalienable rights" like a good old-fashioned apology and some cash.<br/><br/>France's President Emmanuel Macron has previously acknowledged that colonialisation was a crime against humanity (see what we did there?), but hasn't offered an official apology... yet! We're keeping our fingers crossed for a heartfelt sorry from the Elysée Palace, complete with a side of croissants and a bouquet of flowers.<br/><br/>The bill also criminalises the glorification of colonialism, because let's be real, who needs colonial nostalgia when you've got reparations on the table? It's like saying "I'm sorry I tried to kill your ancestors" but then also wearing a "Keep Calm and Carry On" t-shirt - just not done.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news, we heard that French-Algerian novelist Boualem Sansal was arrested at Algiers airport for making remarks that questioned Algeria's borders. We're not sure what he said exactly, but it can't be worse than what we said about the scarf-wearing skills of Algerian lawmakers - "Impressive" doesn't even begin to cover it.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
