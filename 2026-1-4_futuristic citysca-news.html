        <p>BREAKING: Trump Declares Himself Supreme Ruler of Universe, Venezuela Just a Warm-Up<br/><br/>Palm Beach, Florida - In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has declared himself the supreme ruler of the universe, citing his "tremendous" success in overthrowing Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro as proof of his superior leadership skills.<br/><br/>"I mean, who needs democracy when you have me?" Trump boasted at a press conference at his Mar-a-Lago club. "I'm like a superhero, but instead of a cape, I wear a fancy suit and a really good hairpiece."<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Trump has been practicing his authoritarian powers in secret, honing his skills on unsuspecting minions and yes-men.<br/><br/>"It's all about confidence," Trump explained. "If you believe you're right, everyone else will too. And if they don't, well... let's just say I have a few tricks up my sleeve."<br/><br/>In related news, the Venezuelan people are reportedly overjoyed with their new American overlords and are eagerly awaiting their next instruction.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts are warning of a global trend towards authoritarianism, citing Trump's Venezuela intervention as a "textbook example" of how to achieve regime change without actually having to do any work.<br/><br/>"It's like a recipe for disaster," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert on geopolitics. "Just add a dash of ego, a pinch of narcissism, and a healthy dose of military force... voilà! Instant dictatorship."<br/><br/>When asked about the implications of his actions, Trump shrugged off concerns, saying, "Hey, it's just business as usual. I mean, who needs elections when you have me?"<br/><br/>UPDATE: In response to criticism from world leaders, Trump has announced plans to establish a new doctrine - the "Trump Doctrine" - which will prioritize American interests above all else.<br/><br/>"It's not like we haven't done this before," Trump said with a grin. "Just ask my good friend, Vladimir Putin. He knows a thing or two about authoritarianism."<br/><br/>And in a related development, the US has announced plans to invade Mexico next week, citing "creative differences" between Trump and Mexican President Andrés Manuel López Obrador.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story...</p>
