        <h2>TRUMP THREATENS VENEZUELA WITH PARKING TICKET, WORLD IN CHAOS</h2>

        <p>In a bizarre display of presidential threats, Trump warned Venezuela's new interim president that she'll face severe consequences for not complying with US demands, jokingly suggesting she might get a parking ticket in Caracas.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Trump Threatens to Punish Venezuela's New Leader, Says She'll "Pay a Very Big Price"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has warned Venezuela's new interim president Delcy Rodríguez that she will face severe consequences if she doesn't comply with US demands. Rodriguez, who was sworn in as president on Monday, had previously offered to cooperate with the US, but it seems that wasn't enough for Trump.<br/><br/>"It's like, you know, when your kid doesn't do their homework," Trump explained to a reporter on Air Force One. "You gotta crack down hard, or they'll just keep messing around." When asked what kind of consequences Rodríguez could face, Trump grinned mischievously and said, "Oh, I'd say she's got a very good chance of getting a parking ticket... in Caracas."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the deposed president Nicolás Maduro was taken into custody by US special forces over the weekend and is set to appear in court on Monday. His wife Cilia Flores was also arrested, but claims she was just trying to get some coffee at the time.<br/><br/>"Hey, I'm not saying we didn't take her coffee machine," said a source close to the operation. "But let's be real, it was like a Starbucks up in there – they had all sorts of fancy-schmancy coffee drinks."<br/><br/>In response to Trump's threats, Rodríguez has vowed to remain calm and collected, much like a kitten playing with yarn. Her advisors have encouraged her to stay focused on the country's economic woes and not get distracted by Trump's bluster.<br/><br/>"Look, we understand that Mr. Trump can be... enthusiastic," said one Venezuelan official. "But we're not going to let him dictate our national security policy. That's like letting a chicken run the farm – it just wouldn't work out well for anyone."<br/><br/>Colombia's President Gustavo Petro, who was also targeted by Trump in his remarks, has hit back at the US president's claims that he likes making cocaine and selling it to the United States.<br/><br/>"Hey, I resent that," said Petro. "I'm a legitimate leader, with a PhD in economics from Harvard... wait, no – that was my cousin Carlos. But seriously, we're not impressed by Trump's antics."<br/><br/>And finally, the Cuban government has announced two days of national mourning for the 32 "brave Cuban combatants" who were allegedly killed during the US operation.<br/><br/>"We want to send our condolences to their families and offer them a nice plate of rice and beans," said a Cuban spokesperson. "We're also going to have a free-flowing mojito bar at the funeral service, because what's a funeral without some drinks?"</p>
