        <p>**COMEDY NEWS ARTICLE**<br/><br/>**BREAKING: US Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Meet Vladimir Putin, Because Who Needs Diplomacy When You Have Reality TV Stars?**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States government has announced that its top envoy, Steve Witkoff (who we're pretty sure is just a guy from Jersey), will be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. And who's going to join them for this highly anticipated meet-and-greet? None other than Jared Kushner, Donald Trump's favorite son-in-law and self-proclaimed master of the universe.<br/><br/>We're not sure what's more surprising – that Steve Witkoff is still employed by the US government or that Vladimir Putin hasn't invited them both to a game of beer pong yet. Sources close to the Kremlin (okay, we just made that up) have revealed that Putin is secretly a huge fan of "The Real Housewives" and has been binge-watching it for weeks in preparation for this meeting.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been making headlines with his own peace plan, which includes offering Putin a lifetime supply of pierogies if he just puts down his nuclear toys. But let's be real, who needs diplomacy when you have a good old-fashioned game of "Who Can Eat the Most Pierogies in One Sitting"?<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** We've just received word that the meeting between Steve Witkoff, Jared Kushner, and Vladimir Putin has been replaced by a impromptu performance of "The Nutcracker" on ice skates. It's going to be a wild ride, folks!<br/><br/>**ADDITIONAL UPDATE:** And in a shocking turn of events, the ballet-themed meeting was interrupted by a surprise visit from Elton John, who proceeded to sing an impromptu rendition of "Rocket Man" while playing the piano with his feet. We're not sure what's more surreal – this whole situation or the fact that Elton John is still relevant.<br/><br/>**STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!**<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: This article has been completely made up and contains no actual news value whatsoever.
