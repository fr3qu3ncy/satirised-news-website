        <h2>VENEZUELA'S OIL PRODUCTION HAS PLUMMETED FASTER THAN A KARDESHIAN'S MARRIAGE! AND TRUMP IS ALL LIKE "WHERE'S MY OIL?!"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Venezuela's oil production has plummeted faster than a Kardashian's marriage, prompting President Trump to demand their oil while Venezuela just shrugs and says "not my problem".</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>The South American nation's output has plummeted, but we've got a comedy version of this news story that will lift your spirits!<br/><br/>Venezuela: Where the Oil Flows Like Beer at a Bachelor Party<br/><br/>Hey there, folks! So, you know how Venezuela is like the kid who never paid attention in math class? Yeah, their oil production has plummeted faster than a Kardashian's marriage. But don't worry, we're here to break it down for you with a comedy twist!<br/><br/>The US Wants That Oil (But Not Really)<br/><br/>President Donald Trump, aka the guy who still thinks he can build that wall, is all like "Hey, Venezuela! Give me your oil!" And by "give me," I mean the US wants to "acquire" it in a totally not-at-all- shady way. But let's be real, folks, Trump's got more chances of becoming a professional snail trainer than getting his hands on Venezuela's oil.<br/><br/>How Much Oil Does Venezuela Have? (Spoiler: Not Enough)<br/><br/>So, Venezuela's got a gazillion barrels of oil just chillin' in the ground like an emo teenager's feelings. But here's the thing: it's not like they're making a killing off that oil (pun intended). Output's been down since the early 2000s, and we're talking a severe case of "I'm-not- even-going-to-bother-anymore." Like when you forget to water your plants for two months.<br/><br/>Trump: Where's My Oil?<br/><br/>Imagine Trump walking into a party, all like "Hey, where's my oil?" And the host is just like "Uh, dude, it's not about the oil; it's about the snacks!" That's basically what Venezuela's saying to Trump right now. "Dude, we've got oil, but our economy's still in shambles from that time we thought socialism would be a good idea."<br/><br/>Why Is Trump Threatening Maduro? (Short Answer: Because)<br/><br/>So, Trump's all like "Hey, I'm gonna take you down, Maduro!" And the people are just like "Uh, isn't this about oil?" Nope! It's totally not. It's about who's got the best Twitter game (hint: it's still Kanye).<br/><br/>The Challenges: AKA Venezuela's To-Do List<br/><br/>Analysts say it'll take tens of billions of dollars and possibly a decade to get Venezuela's oil production back on track. That's like trying to teach a cat how to do math – not gonna happen. But hey, at least they've got some decent memes out of this whole thing!<br/><br/>That's our take on the situation! Thanks for tuning in, folks. Don't forget to tip your waitstaff (or in this case, your oil-producing nation).</p>
