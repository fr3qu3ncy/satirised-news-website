        <p>TRUMP'S WARNING LOOMS OVER IRAN PROTESTS RESPONSE (THE FUNNY VERSION)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iranian authorities have been spotted doing absolutely nothing in response to mass protests. It's unclear if this is due to the severe lack of motivation or just because they're trying not to get caught by their own internet filters.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the regime, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Khamenei was overheard saying, "You know what? I think we'll just let them protest for a bit. Maybe they'll get bored and go watch cat videos on YouTube." When questioned about this, his spokesperson clarified that it was actually just a figure of speech, but then proceeded to stare blankly into space for 17 minutes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has been making the rounds, warning Iran that if they don't shape up, he'll be over there like a hot knife through butter, making sure they know who's boss. His exact words were, "Listen, Iran, I'm not messing around. If you don't behave, I'll send in the Ghostbusters to take care of business."<br/><br/>In related news, the Iranian government has announced that it will be introducing a new national pastime: Extreme Ironing. This involves ironing clothes while BASE jumping off tall buildings. It's unclear what this has to do with anything, but sources close to the regime claim it's a vital part of their strategy to distract from the protests.<br/><br/>As protests continue to sweep across the country, Iranian authorities have been seen donning funny hats and doing trust falls in an attempt to diffuse the situation. When asked about this, a spokesperson for the regime claimed that it was all just a big misunderstanding, but then proceeded to trip over his own feet and face-plant into a nearby trash can.<br/><br/>The United States, meanwhile, has offered its support to the protesters, sending over a team of experts in Extreme Knitting to help them stay warm during the chilly winter nights. When asked about this, President Trump said, "Hey, we're all about supporting our friends and allies... as long as they're not trying to take over the world with their giant robot armies."<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, it's been revealed that the Iranian government has been secretly training a team of ninja accountants to sneak into the country's financial institutions and steal all the money. When asked about this, a spokesperson for the regime claimed that it was just a "training exercise" and not actually related to the protests at all.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. Iran in chaos, Trump making threats, and Extreme Ironing is now a thing. What's next? Who knows? But one thing's for sure: it'll be interesting!</p>
