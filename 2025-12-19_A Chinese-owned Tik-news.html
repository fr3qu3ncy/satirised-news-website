        <p>BREAKING: TikTok Owner Signs Deal to Avoid US Ban, But Will It Be Enough?<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the owner of TikTok, ByteDance, has signed a deal with American and global investors to operate its business in the US. Because what could possibly go wrong when you mix TikTok with America's users?<br/><br/>The deal, which is set to close on January 22nd (coincidentally, the same day as the annual "I'm so tired of this news" conference), would end years of efforts by Washington to force ByteDance to sell its US operations over national security concerns. It's like they say: "You can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear, but you can try to make a TikTok app out of a Chinese company!"<br/><br/>Under the agreement, ByteDance will retain 19.9% of the business, while Oracle, Silver Lake, and Abu Dhabi-based MGX (who knew they were even involved in this mess?) will hold 15% each. Another 30.1% will be held by affiliates of existing ByteDance investors, because who doesn't love a good acronym-filled deal? It's like a game of "Deal or No Deal," but with more lawyers and less actual deals.<br/><br/>The White House previously said that Oracle would license TikTok's recommendation algorithm as part of the deal. Because what's a social media app without a healthy dose of algorithms telling you who to follow and what to watch?<br/><br/>The deal comes after a series of delays, including a delay in April 2024 when Congress passed a law to ban the app over national security concerns. It was like they were trying to avoid the question: "What's the holdup, guys? Can't we just get this done?"<br/><br/>President Trump even got involved, saying he had spoken on the phone with China's President Xi Jinping and that the latter had given the deal the go-ahead. Because what does one do when faced with a complex international situation? Call your BFF and ask for advice!<br/><br/>The platform's future remained unclear after the leaders met face-to-face in October. It was like they were trying to avoid each other, but ultimately ended up having a nice cup of tea together.<br/><br/>TikTok's boss, Shou Zi Chew, sent out a memo to employees saying that the deal would enable "over 170 million Americans to continue discovering a world of endless possibilities as part of a vital global community." Because what's more American than a little bit of social media chaos?<br/><br/>Some users expressed caution at the prospect of new investors. Small business owner Tiffany Cianci, who has over 300,000 followers and nearly four million likes on the platform, said she hopes the incoming investors will maintain the same user experience for entrepreneurs like her. She's like the TikTok version of a concerned aunt, worrying about everyone's feelings.<br/><br/>Senate Democrat Ron Wyden of Oregon even chimed in, saying that the deal would not do "a thing to protect the privacy of American users." Because what's more important than protecting people's online identities? (Just kidding, it's clearly more important to have a functioning government and economy.)<br/><br/>In conclusion, the TikTok owner has signed a deal to avoid a US ban. But will it be enough? Only time (and several lawsuits) will tell.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, or not, because who really cares anymore?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, the Kennedy Center in Washington D.C. has added President Trump's name to its facade. Because why not? It's not like they have anything better to do with their time and resources.</p>
