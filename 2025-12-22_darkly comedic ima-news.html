        <p>CAR BOMB KILLS RUSSIAN GENERAL IN MOSCOW, OFFICIALS SAY "IT WAS JUST A REALLY BAD TRAFFIC JAM"<br/><br/>MOSCOW, RUSSIA - In a bizarre turn of events, a car bomb exploded in Moscow on Monday morning, killing Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov, the third military official to have been killed in bomb attacks in the Russian capital over the last year. According to eyewitnesses, the blast was so powerful that it not only destroyed the Kia Sorento driven by Sarvarov but also caused a nearby Starbucks to run out of coffee.<br/><br/>"I was just sipping my morning latte when suddenly the whole car park exploded," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, I've seen some crazy things in Moscow before, but this was just ridiculous."<br/><br/>Investigations are underway, and officials are still trying to determine who was responsible for the blast. However, insiders claim that they have found a crucial piece of evidence: a receipt from McDonald's.<br/><br/>"We're looking into the possibility that Sarvarov's killer might have been someone with a beef against him," said a spokesperson for the Investigative Committee. "After all, what's more Russian than a good old-fashioned vendetta over food?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin has issued a statement expressing his deepest condolences to Sarvarov's family and promised to take swift action to prevent such incidents in the future.<br/><br/>"We will not rest until we find out who was responsible for this heinous crime," said Putin. "And if it turns out to be a prank by Borat, well... that's just a whole different can of worms."<br/><br/>Sarvarov, 56, was a decorated war veteran with numerous medals and honors under his belt. In fact, some sources claim that he was so highly decorated that he had to wear a special reinforced vest to the funeral of his mother-in-law.<br/><br/>"General Sarvarov was a true hero of Russia," said a fellow military officer. "He single-handedly won the war in Syria, fixed the economy, and even managed to cook a mean borscht. We'll miss him dearly."<br/><br/>The incident has sparked widespread outrage on social media, with many people expressing their shock and horror at the senseless violence.<br/><br/>"Just when you thought it was safe to go back to Moscow," tweeted one user. "Car bombs are so last season. Can we get a new trend going, like... I don't know... Pokémon-themed street performers or something?"<br/><br/>The situation is still unfolding, but one thing is certain: Lt Gen Fanil Sarvarov will be deeply missed by his colleagues and the people of Moscow.<br/><br/>Rest in peace, General. May your spirit live on in our hearts, and may we never forget the importance of a good cup of coffee in these trying times.</p>
