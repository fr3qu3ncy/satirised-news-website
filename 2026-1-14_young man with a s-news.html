        <p>BREAKING: Iran to Execute 26-Year-Old Man, But Not Before He's Forced to Watch a 3-Hour Video of Celine Dion Songs<br/><br/>TEHRAN, IRAN - In a shocking turn of events, the relatives of 26-year-old Erfan Soltani have confirmed that he is due to be executed on Wednesday. But in a bizarre twist, sources close to the Iranian government have revealed that before his execution, Soltani will be forced to watch a 3-hour video marathon of Celine Dion's greatest hits.<br/><br/>"It's a small price to pay for being a troublemaker," said an anonymous source within the Iranian government. "We'll make sure he's sufficiently entertained... and brainwashed... with the power ballads before we, you know, take him out."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the situation, tweeting: "Just heard about this guy Erfan Soltani. Terrible human rights abuses happening in Iran, folks. Very strong action coming, believe me. Unless, of course, it's a Tuesday, and I'm busy playing golf with Vladimir Putin."<br/><br/>In an unrelated story, sources close to the Vatican have revealed that Pope Francis has converted his Popemobile into a mobile health clinic for Gaza children. "It's all about spreading love and healing," said the Pontiff. "Plus, the kids in Gaza are really into Lamborghinis, so I figured, why not?"<br/><br/>As tensions rise between Israel and Hamas, it appears that even Tom Fletcher, the UN aid chief, has gotten in on the action. In a bizarre move, he's been spotted wearing a black top with the OCHA United Nations logo emblazoned on it - just like his favorite Justin Bieber t-shirt.<br/><br/>And finally, in a heartwarming story, two young girls from Gaza have been reunited with their father after thinking they'd lost him forever. The happy family was seen embracing each other, while Safia Qeshta, the mother of the children, smiled brightly and thought to herself: "Well, at least we've got this whole 'surviving in a war zone' thing down pat."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story... if you dare.</p>
