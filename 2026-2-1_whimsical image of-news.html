        <p>INDIA'S BUDGET: A COMEDY VERSION<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, India's Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman appeared on stage dressed as a giant chicken, flapping her wings and clucking loudly. The crowd went wild as she began to read the budget speech from a tablet that was actually just a smartphone with a cat video playing.<br/><br/>The budget, which was meant to focus on infrastructure and defence spending, took an unexpected turn when Sitharaman announced that all government officials would be required to wear superhero capes to work. "It's a small step for man, but a giant leap for bureaucracy," she quipped.<br/><br/>Infrastructure spending was indeed increased by 9%, but only if the projects were built on top of existing infrastructure. For example, a new highway was proposed to be constructed directly above an old one, with the added feature of a funhouse mirror that would make drivers look like they're shrinking. "It's all about the optics," said Sitharaman.<br/><br/>The government also announced plans to set up dedicated corridors for rare earth minerals, which would be staffed by robots wearing tiny top hats and monocles. "It's a classic case of supply and demand," explained a spokesperson.<br/><br/>In a bizarre move, the budget proposed a tax holiday for foreign cloud companies making data-centre investments in India, but only if they agreed to provide free Wi-Fi to all citizens during Diwali. "It's a win-win situation," said a tech expert, "unless you're trying to use your phone during Diwali, then it's just a big mess."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the markets were left reeling after Sitharaman announced a hike in the Security Transaction Tax (STT) on futures and options trading. As traders panicked, they began to trade their stocks for pizza coupons, which caused a brief but intense surge in the value of Domino's Pizza.<br/><br/>The budget also included plans to rationalize the goods and services tax (GST), which would involve replacing all GST forms with a giant Rubik's Cube that everyone had to solve before filing their taxes. "It's just a matter of perspective," said a tax expert, "or maybe we're all just crazy."<br/><br/>In conclusion, India's budget was a wild ride full of unexpected twists and turns. As Sitharaman wrapped up her speech, she turned to the audience and said, "And that's not all, folks! I almost forgot to mention the plans for a giant water slide in Parliament House." The crowd erupted into cheers as the Finance Minister began to dance the Macarena.<br/><br/>related articles<br/><br/>* India's budget: A guide to understanding the jargon<br/>* What's new in India's budget?<br/>* Can India's economy survive the chicken dance?<br/><br/>(Note: All events and announcements mentioned in this article are entirely fictional and for comedic purposes only.)</p>
