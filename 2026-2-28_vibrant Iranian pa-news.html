        <p>BREAKING: Iran's Internet Blackout Turns into Dance Party<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Iranians have taken to the streets (or what used to be the streets before the internet blackout) to celebrate the country's latest woes. Despite an almost total internet shutdown, people are still managing to find ways to have a party.<br/><br/>It all started when videos began circulating on social media showing loud explosions and people running in panic. But instead of panicking, some Iranians decided to use their newfound freedom from the internet to, well, party.<br/><br/>"It was around 09:40 local time (06:10 GMT) when we heard the first explosion," said one resident, who wished to remain anonymous. "But then we realized it wasn't an earthquake or a terrorist attack – it was just people having fun in the streets!"<br/><br/>Videos shared online show teenagers dancing and chanting slogans like "I love Trump" and "Down with the regime!" while others were seen sipping tea and laughing with friends.<br/><br/>One resident, who was spotted wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and dancing on top of a car, said: "I've never felt so free in my life! The internet blackout is the best thing that's happened to us in years – we can finally have some fun without worrying about what our parents will say."<br/><br/>The celebrations were even more bizarre when a group of people were seen doing the cha cha slide on top of a giant inflatable unicorn, while others were busy playing video games and eating pizza.<br/><br/>But not everyone was happy with the party atmosphere. Some Iranians were overheard saying things like: "This is all just a distraction from the real issues facing our country" and "We're not going to let Trump think he can just come in here and start bombing us – we'll show him who's boss!"<br/><br/>Despite these dissenting views, the party continued into the night, with people laughing, dancing, and generally having the time of their lives.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Iran's President Says Country Will Not Be Defeated by a Few Well-Placed Bombs<br/><br/>In response to the recent attacks on Iranian leadership sites, President Hassan Rouhani has vowed that the country will not be defeated by "a few well-placed bombs."<br/><br/>"We may have lost some buildings and a few important people," he said in a statement. "But we've also gained something much more valuable – a sense of national unity and a renewed commitment to our great leader, Ayatollah Khamenei!"<br/><br/>The President went on to say that the country would not be deterred by the attacks and would continue to fight for its rights and freedoms.<br/><br/>"We will not be intimidated by the United States or Israel," he said. "We will rise up stronger than ever and show them what we're made of – a people who refuse to be defeated!"<br/><br/>And with that, the party continued into the night, with Iranians dancing and chanting slogans like "We are the champions of the world!" and "Iran will never surrender!"<br/><br/>FINAL UPDATE: Internet Blackout Ends; Iran's People Return to Normal Life<br/><br/>After several days of partying, the internet blackout finally came to an end. And as you might expect, people returned to their normal lives with a sigh of relief.<br/><br/>"It was nice while it lasted," said one resident, who wished to remain anonymous. "But now we can get back to our usual routine – which mostly involves arguing with each other and complaining about the government."<br/><br/>And so, life in Iran returns to normal. The parties are over, the celebrations have stopped, and people are once again busy with their daily lives.<br/><br/>But just for a moment, let's all take a deep breath and remember the joy of dancing on top of an inflatable unicorn while eating pizza and playing video games...</p>
