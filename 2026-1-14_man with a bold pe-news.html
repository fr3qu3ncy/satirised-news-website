        <p>"Ford Heckler: From Zero to Hero in 24 Hours (and a $700,000 GoFundMe)"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, a man who was suspended from his job at Ford after heckling US President Donald Trump during a visit to the company's factory has become an overnight sensation - and a GoFundMe superstar. TJ Sabula, the alleged heckler, found himself at the center of a media storm after he shouted expletives at Trump, who responded with a middle-finger gesture.<br/><br/>But instead of facing ridicule and shame, Sabula has been hailed as a hero by many, including his union, the United Auto Workers (UAW). In fact, two separate GoFundMe pages have raised nearly $700,000 (£521,000) for him from over 27,000 donors. That's right - in just 24 hours, this guy went from being a "lunatic" to a millionaire.<br/><br/>The White House defended Trump's actions, saying the President gave an "appropriate and unambiguous response." However, others are questioning whether a middle-finger gesture is really the best way to respond to someone who's shouting expletives. As one Twitter user quipped, "I'm pretty sure 'fingers down' isn't in the presidential etiquette manual."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sabula has been enjoying his newfound fame. He told The Washington Post that he has "no regrets" about what he did and even got a shoutout from the cast of "The Simpsons," who tweeted: "D'oh! Who needs a Nobel Peace Prize when you can get a GoFundMe campaign?"<br/><br/>It's worth noting that Sabula's union, the UAW, is defending his actions as an exercise in "freedom of speech." However, others are pointing out that this freedom comes with consequences - like getting suspended from your job.<br/><br/>As one commentator joked, "I guess you could say Sabula has taken 'heckling' to a whole new level."<br/><br/>The top donors to the GoFundMe campaigns include:<br/><br/>* A mysterious entity known only as "Biden2024" (yes, that Biden)<br/>* A group of SpaceX engineers who apparently have nothing better to do with their time<br/>* And, in a surprise move, the cast of "The Muppet Show," who donated $10,000 and a signed poster of Kermit the Frog.<br/><br/>It's anyone's guess what will happen next in this strange saga. Will Sabula use his newfound wealth to become a reality TV star? Only time (and a good publicist) will tell.</p>
