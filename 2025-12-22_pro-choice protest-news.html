        <p>ABORTION CLINIC FIGHTS FOR SURVIVAL IN TOWN DIVIDED BY STATE LINES AND PIZZA ORDERS<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the only abortion clinic in town is fighting an eviction notice and other efforts to shut it down. Because, you know, what's more fun than a good ol' fashioned battle over reproductive rights?<br/><br/>The clinic, Bristol Women's Health, has been operating in the city of Bristol, Virginia for years, much to the chagrin of anti-abortion activists who are like, "Uh, no, you can't have an abortion here. Unless you order a pizza from Pizza Hut first. Then, and only then, will we consider your request."<br/><br/>The clinic's landlords, brothers Chase and Chadwick King, claim that the clinic fraudulently concealed its true intentions (i.e., performing abortions) to get a lease on their property. To which the clinic is all, "Uh, no, our website clearly states that we do abortions. You must have missed the part where it says 'free pizza with every abortion'."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, anti-abortion activists are like, "No, no, no! This can't be happening! We'll just pass some ordinances and make sure this clinic doesn't exist anymore!" And then they go to city council meetings and say things like, "But, but, but... what about the Comstock Act? That's a 152-year-old federal law that prohibits sending or receiving material via post which might induce an abortion! We can use it to shut down this clinic for good!"<br/><br/>The town of Bristol is basically the epicenter of the debate over abortion rights. I mean, who needs a Starbucks when you have a clinic that provides abortions on demand? But seriously, folks, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack... or a decent slice of pizza in a small town.<br/><br/>As the city's planning director said, "It has been more stressful than dealing with a parking lot. It's not something that has really come to the local level before." Yeah, because nothing says "local issue" like a bunch of out-of-state abortion seekers trying to get an abortion at your clinic.<br/><br/>The Family Foundation, an anti-abortion lobbying group, is all for restricting abortion access in Bristol by making use of local bylaws. Because, you know, if you can't win at Capitol Hill, why not fight at City Hall? It's like a game of whack-a-mole, where every time you try to shut down the clinic, it just pops back up again.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Pastor Mark Lee Dickson is all about enforcing the Comstock Act and shutting down the clinic for good. Because, you know, it's not like people have a right to choose what happens to their own bodies or anything.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's a wild ride in Bristol, folks! Where abortion rights are concerned, it's every man (or woman) for themselves... and by that, I mean, get ready for a parking lot full of protesters, a bunch of ordinances, and some seriously bad pizza.</p>
