        <p>EUROPEAN MIGRATION CHAOS: WOMEN TRAVEL ALONE AND GET RAPED<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it's been revealed that women are traveling alone to Europe and getting raped. Not just any women, mind you, but women who have fled their homes in Nigeria because of abuse. Because what could possibly go wrong with that plan?<br/><br/>According to sources, Esther (not her real name) was promised a job and a home in the UK by a woman she met on the streets of Lagos. Sounds legit. She then proceeded to cross the desert to Libya, where she was forced into sex work for four months before escaping and crossing the Mediterranean in a rubber dinghy. Because what's a little ocean journey without some added excitement?<br/><br/>After being rescued by the Italian coast guard and taken to Lampedusa, Esther claimed asylum three times before being granted refugee status. I mean, it's not like she had anything better to do with her life than run from one asylum office to another.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets worse! The International Rescue Committee has reported a 250% annual rise in the number of single adult women arriving in Italy on the Balkan route. That's right, folks, more women are getting raped and exploited by smugglers, traffickers, and other migrants because... why not?<br/><br/>"It's impossible to sustain mass migration -- there is no way," says Nicola Procaccini, an MP in Giorgia Meloni's right-wing government. "We can guarantee a safe life to those women who are really in danger, but not to all of them." Yeah, because what could possibly go wrong with that plan?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rakib Ehsan at the conservative think tank Policy Exchange is all about "controlled compassion." You know, like when you're trying to get a decent coffee and someone gets in your way. "The key is controlled compassion," he says. Because who needs actual help or support when you can just have a little bit of control?<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks, the Italian government has got this under control. After all, they've changed their assessment of Nigeria from unsafe to safe. I mean, what could possibly go wrong with that decision? And if you're one of those women who's been subjected to FGM and are now seeking asylum, well, sorry not sorry. You'll just have to deal with the trauma and PTSD on your own because no one's got time for that.<br/><br/>In conclusion, European migration is a chaotic nightmare, and women are getting raped left and right. So, if you're thinking of traveling alone to Europe, just remember: it's all about the romance of it all... and the potential rape and exploitation.</p>
