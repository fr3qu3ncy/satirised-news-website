        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela Accuses Trump of Trying to Steal Its Oil Again (But This Time with a Kung Pao Chicken Twist)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has seized its second oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, sparking outrage from the Venezuelan government. But what's really got everyone talking is that the US Coast Guard, led by the fearless Secretary Kristi Noem (who just so happens to be a secret agent), boarded the ship with a team of highly trained ninjas and a cargo hold full of Kung Pao chicken.<br/><br/>"It was like a scene from 'Mission: Impossible'," said a source close to the operation. "They had a guy in a rubber ducky costume, and another one who looked suspiciously like a giant inflatable hammer. We were all like, 'Wait, what's going on here?' And then they just walked out with the oil and left us wondering if we'd really seen that."<br/><br/>The tanker, which was sailing under the flag of Panama (but had also flown the Jolly Roger in its past life), was carrying a cargo of "specially sanctioned" PDVSA oil. When asked to comment on the incident, Venezuela's President Nicolás Maduro simply shrugged and said, "Well, I guess that's just another example of Trump's 'warmongering threats' coming true."<br/><br/>In response to the blockade, Venezuela has threatened to file a complaint with the UN Security Council and "other multilateral agencies" – but only if they can get someone to drive them to the meeting. "We're still trying to figure out how to use Google Maps," said a Venezuelan official.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, US Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth took to social media to declare that the US would continue to "unflinchingly conduct maritime interdiction operations... to dismantle illicit criminal networks." But then he accidentally posted a selfie with the caption: "Just had the best tacos ever! #TacoTuesday"<br/><br/>As tensions between the two countries continue to escalate, one thing is clear: the world will never be the same again. And if you're wondering what's next for Venezuela and the US, just remember: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But when life gives you a blockade and a bunch of Kung Pao chicken, make... well, that's still to be determined.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The US has announced plans to seize a third oil tanker, but this time with a special surprise for the crew: a screening of "Titanic" on the ship's deck while they're being held in international waters. When asked about the move, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, someone's gotta keep the crew entertained while we get our hands on all that sweet, sweet oil."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
