        <p>This year's White House Christmas decorations have been revealed to be a complete disaster, featuring a Lego portrait of Donald Trump and George Washington, 3D-printed ornaments that play "Jingle Bells" on repeat, and Melania's overly-enthusiastic tinsel-covered decor.</p>

        <p>**Breaking News**<br/><br/>"Home Is Where the Heart Is"...or so they thought.<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, this year's Christmas decorations at the White House have been revealed to be a total disaster. The theme was supposed to be "Home Is Where the Heart Is," but it seems like someone forgot to tell that to the interior decorator...or maybe it was just a clever ploy to drive Trump crazy.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation, the decorations were installed by 1,500 volunteers who worked for ONE WEEK. That's right, folks, one whole week! I mean, who needs weekends when you're decorating the White House? It's not like they have better things to do...like watching cat videos or something.<br/><br/>The pièce de résistance of this year's decorations is a Lego portrait of Donald Trump and George Washington. Because what's Christmas without a few hundred thousand pieces of plastic and some very confused historians? I mean, who knew the Founding Fathers were fans of The Lego Movie?<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! There are also 3D-printed ornaments that have been programmed to play "Jingle Bells" on repeat for eternity. That's right, folks, every time you walk into the White House this holiday season, you'll be greeted by the incessant sound of Bing Crosby singing about dashing through the snow...in a digital loop that will drive you absolutely bonkers.<br/><br/>And if all that wasn't enough, Melania Trump has revealed her own Christmas decorations in a shocking display of holiday cheer. Or should I say, holiday terror? Her decorations feature an endless supply of tinsel, garland, and butterflies, because who needs actual decorations when you can just copy-paste the same thing everywhere?<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! The White House has assured us that everything is perfectly normal...and by "perfectly normal," I mean utterly chaotic. After all, as any good politician will tell you, it's always a good idea to throw a bunch of money at a problem and hope for the best.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story...or not, because let's be real, who actually cares about Christmas decorations?<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/><br/>We've just received word that Leonardo DiCaprio was spotted at the White House, giving an impromptu eulogy to Jane Goodall. Because what better way to honor a primatologist than with a bunch of flowery language and a nod to the absurdity of it all? <br/><br/>And in other news, the last penny ever minted has been discovered...and it's not even worth the trouble of finding.<br/><br/>Stay classy, America!</p>
