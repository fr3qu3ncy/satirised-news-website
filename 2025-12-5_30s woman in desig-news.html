        <p>BREAKING: MAN WHO KILLED EX-JAPAN PM SHINZO ABE HAS FINAL FLASH OF REGRET... AND IT'S JUST AS SAD AS HIS MOMENT OF TRIUMPH<br/><br/>Tetsuya Yamagami, the man who assassinated former Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe with a homemade gun, has finally broken his silence and expressed deep regret towards Abe's widow, Akie. But, in a shocking twist, his apology was met with a resounding "meh" from Akie herself.<br/><br/>"I feel deeply sorry," Yamagami said, trying to hold back tears, but mostly just because he remembered he forgot to water his plants that morning. "I have caused you three and a half years of suffering... I have no excuse."<br/><br/>Akie Abe, resplendent in her designer sunglasses and perfectly coiffed hairdo, simply rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath, "Please, sweetie, I've been dealing with your kind of drama since my husband's assassination. You think you're sorry? Try being a widow with a gazillion lawyers breathing down your neck."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Yamagami's defense team was overheard whispering to each other, "Uh, boss, maybe we should work on the 'sorry' part. It sounds like he's just saying it because he's trying to get some points for his next parole hearing."<br/><br/>The courtroom erupted into chaos as Yamagami's lawyers began arguing over who got to claim the extra-large coffee mug that Abe's widow had brought with her, only to have it snatched by none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who was sitting in the front row wearing a "I'm not here for the drama" t-shirt.<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Yamagami himself suddenly jumped up from his seat and started doing backflips while shouting, "I'M THE ROCK! I'M THE ONE WHO'S BEEN PLAYING YOU GUYS ALL ALONG!" Only to be tackled by security guards who whispered, "Uh, buddy, we think you've been watching too many WWE matches."<br/><br/>As the courtroom descended into complete pandemonium, Abe's widow calmly pulled out her phone and tweeted, "#JusticeForShinzo #SorryNotSorry".<br/><br/>UPDATE: Yamagami has since been seen walking out of the courthouse wearing a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt, with a pointed arrow pointing directly at himself. The Rock, meanwhile, has been spotted sipping coffee and enjoying the chaos from his seat in the front row.</p>
