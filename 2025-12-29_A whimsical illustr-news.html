        <p>BREAKING: US Pledges $2 Billion to UN, But Tries to "Adapt or Die" with Conditions<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the United States has pledged $2 billion to fund United Nations (UN) humanitarian programmes. However, in a bizarre twist, the funding comes with some seriously weird conditions.<br/><br/>According to sources, the US has told the UN to "adapt or die". Yes, you read that right. It's like the US is trying to be the universe's own personal motivational speaker, but instead of saying "you got this!", they're saying "you better shape up, or ship out!".<br/><br/>The conditions for receiving these life-saving funds are as follows:<br/><br/>* You can only use the money in countries where Beyoncé has performed a sold-out concert.<br/>* No funding will be provided to any country with a McDonald's franchise. This is because, according to US officials, "McDonald's is a symbol of American imperialism and our taxpayers' dollars should not go towards promoting such evil".<br/>* All aid must be delivered via a conga line of cute kittens wearing tiny backpacks.<br/>* Any project involving the word "climate" will automatically be rejected, as it's just too...un-American.<br/><br/>Despite these ridiculous conditions, UN officials are trying to remain optimistic. "We're thrilled to receive this funding," said Tom Fletcher, the UN's emergency relief chief. "However, we're also a bit confused about what exactly is expected of us in terms of 'adapting' to these new rules."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jeremy Lewin, President Trump's Under Secretary for Foreign Assistance, is quoted as saying: "The US will not be bullied by the UN into providing funding to just anyone. We have standards, folks! And if you can't meet those standards, then maybe you shouldn't be receiving our precious taxpayer dollars."<br/><br/>As a result of these conditions, aid agencies are now scrambling to rebrand their humanitarian efforts with cute kittens and McDonald's-free logos.<br/><br/>UPDATE: A spokesperson for the US State Department has just confirmed that they will not be providing any further explanation about the $2 billion funding or the "adapt or die" clause. When asked why, they simply said: "That's classified information, dude."<br/><br/>In related news:<br/><br/>* Beyoncé has announced a new world tour to coincide with her now-$10 billion net worth.<br/>* McDonald's stocks have plummeted due to fears of being associated with American imperialism.<br/>* Local kittens are now in high demand for their tiny backpack-delivery services.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
