        <p>The White House's 2025 Christmas decorations were a "Block-buster" of absurdity, featuring a Lego portrait of Donald Trump and George Washington alongside cat-shaped cookie jars, tiny sock trees, and Chuck Norris as a holiday guard.</p>

        <p>Breaking News: Trump's Christmas Decorations Get a Lego-ular Makeover!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the White House has unveiled its 2025 Christmas decorations, and let's just say they're a real "Block-buster"! This year's theme is "Home Is Where the Heart Is," but it looks like someone got a little carried away with the Lego bricks.<br/><br/>Melania Trump, resplendent in her festive finery (and a rather fetching pair of reindeer antlers), revealed the decorations, which feature a stunning Lego portrait of Donald Trump and George Washington. We're not sure what's more impressive – the fact that they managed to get the two presidents in the same picture or the sheer amount of cheese on display.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The decorations also include 3D-printed ornaments shaped like cat-shaped cookie jars (because, why not?), a Christmas tree made entirely out of tiny little socks (we're guessing these are the ones that got lost in the wash), and a special appearance by Chuck Norris, who's been tasked with guarding the White House from any would-be "naughty" listers.<br/><br/>When asked about the inspiration behind this year's decorations, Melania said, "I wanted to make sure everyone felt included, even if they're on the naughty list. After all, as the great philosopher, Dolly Parton, once said, 'If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain'...or in this case, a bunch of Lego bricks and cat-shaped cookie jars."<br/><br/>In other news, the White House has announced that they're now offering "Lego Therapy" sessions for anyone who's feeling stressed or anxious during the holiday season. We're not sure what that entails, but we're guessing it involves a lot of clicking and clacking sounds.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Donald Trump took to Twitter to say, "Just saw the most fantastic Christmas decorations at the White House! They're yuge, folks – just yuge. And let me tell you, no one knows more about great decorations than I do." We're not sure what's more astonishing – his bold claim or the fact that he managed to fit an entire Wikipedia article on "The History of Christmas Decorations" into 280 characters.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The White House has outdone itself with this year's holiday decorations. Who needs a functioning government when you can have Lego portraits and cat-shaped cookie jars?</p>
