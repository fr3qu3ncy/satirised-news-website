        <p>Ukrainian President Zelensky's top aide has been fired, but the real question is: who's going to pay for his therapy sessions after being forced to resign?

In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky's chief of staff Andriy Yermak has stepped down from his position due to allegations of corruption. But let's be real, the real question is: how is he going to pay for all those therapy sessions after being forced to leave his job? I mean, come on, the man was caught red-handed (or should I say, red-handled?) with his hands in the cookie jar.

In other news, US special envoy Steve Witkoff is set to meet with Russian President Vladimir Putin and Jared Kushner. Because what's a meeting without a little bit of nepotism thrown in for good measure? It's like the old saying goes: "You can't choose your family, but you can choose who you want to sit next to you at the dinner table."

Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Zelensky is trying to negotiate with Russia over the territorial issue. But let's be real, it's not like anyone really cares about Ukraine's sovereignty. I mean, who needs a country when you have a nice patch of land and some cute, cuddly bears? Just kidding, folks! (Or am I?)

In related news, Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner is joining the meeting with Witkoff and Putin. Because what's a team without a little bit of daddy's boy syndrome thrown in for good measure? It's like the old saying goes: "If it's not broke, don't fix it... unless you're Jared Kushner, then just make it up as you go along."

As the diplomatic talks continue, we can only wonder what other surprises are in store. Will there be a draft peace plan that's heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands? Will Ukraine give up its sovereignty and security guarantees to Russia? And most importantly, will anyone actually care about any of this?

Stay tuned, folks! It's going to be a wild ride.</p>
