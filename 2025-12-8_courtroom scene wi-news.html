        <p>BREAKING: Trump V Slaughter, The Boring Court Case That Just Got A Whole Lot More Interesting<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case that will determine whether President Donald Trump can fire top officials at federal agencies without cause. Because, you know, it's not like they're already being controlled by the White House or anything.<br/><br/>The case in question is Trump v Slaughter, and it involves Rebecca Slaughter, a Democratic member of the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) who was fired by Trump earlier this year for being "inconsistent with [the] Administration's priorities". Because, clearly, her priorities were not aligned with Trump's ego.<br/><br/>During oral arguments on Monday, the four conservative justices on the court appeared to be rooting for Team Trump. Justice Neil Gorsuch even called the Humphrey's Executor ruling, which established that federal agencies can have some independence from the White House, an "indefensible outlier" and a "decaying husk" of a Supreme Court decision. Who knew he was such a fan of 90-year-old court precedents?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the three liberal justices were like, "Uh, no you don't, guys. This is a huge deal for individual liberty and the independence of federal agencies." But, alas, they're outnumbered by the conservative crew.<br/><br/>The Trump administration has argued that President Trump should have full control over government agencies, even those set up by Congress to be shielded from presidential interference. Because, you know, it's not like the Founding Fathers had any idea about checks and balances or anything.<br/><br/>If the court rules in favor of Trump, it could have major implications for the independence of federal agencies like the FTC, which was established in 1914 to protect the public from deceptive business practices and unfair competition. It's like, what's next? The President gets to fire whoever he wants at NASA because, hey, space is cool?<br/><br/>In related news, the court has also agreed to take up a separate case involving Lisa Cook, a member of the Federal Reserve Board of Governors who was fired by Trump. Because, clearly, she was just not doing her job in keeping the economy under his thumb.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling tale of executive power and federal agency drama!</p>
