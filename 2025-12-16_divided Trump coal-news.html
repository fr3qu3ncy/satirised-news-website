        <p>The Trump coalition has imploded into a "Team of Rivals... More Like Team of Clowns" as his loyalists turn on each other and the President's predictably poor leadership leaves everyone scrambling for relevance.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: MAGA Mayhem Ensues as Trump's Coalition Implodes<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the once-loyal Trump coalition has begun to fray at the seams, like a cheap suit worn by a Kardashian cousin. It seems that President Donald Trump's prediction that "the next Republican presidential candidate is probably sitting at this table" was more like a warning sign that his inner circle is about to implode.<br/><br/>As Trump sat in his newly redecorated, gold-plated cabinet room (because who doesn't love a good gilded cage?), he gazed out at the sea of faces and muttered something about "eternity." Yeah, because three years is basically an eternity when you're 78 and still wearing pleated pants.<br/><br/>Sources close to the White House (i.e., the janitor) claim that Trump's team has been feuding over policy like a bunch of teenagers arguing over whose turn it is to use the Xbox. Meanwhile, Congresswoman Marjorie Taylor Greene has gone rogue, accusing Trump of losing touch with his base – aka "the people who still think he's a cool guy."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a headline in The Washington Post asked: "Maga leaders warn Trump the base is checking out. Will he listen?" To which Trump responded with a resounding "nope" and went back to playing golf with his buddies.<br/><br/>Team of Rivals? More Like Team of Clowns<br/><br/>As Trump's cabinet members vied for attention, it was like watching a high school debate team try to out-nerd each other. Vice-President JD Vance, the presumptive heir apparent, looked more like a frat boy trying to impress his bro with a ratty old MAGA hat.<br/><br/>Secretary Marco Rubio, on the other hand, seemed to have undergone some sort of bizarre, Trump-inspired transformation – think "Make America Great Again" meets "I'm-with-Stupid." And don't even get us started on Secretary Robert F Kennedy Jr's "Make America Healthy Again" agenda, which is basically just a fancy way of saying "vaccines are bad, man."<br/><br/>The Future of MAGA: A Mystery Wrapped in an Enigma<br/><br/>So, who will emerge as the next big thing in Trump's coalition? Will it be JD Vance, Marco Rubio, or maybe some up-and-coming senator from Utah with a questionable comb-over? The world may never know.<br/><br/>One thing is certain, though: when Trump finally does exit stage left (or right, we're not really sure), the Republican Party will be left scrambling to figure out what just happened. And as for Trump's legacy? Well, let's just say it'll be a real challenge to top his achievements in the art of self-promotion and general buffoonery.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks – this is going to be a wild ride!</p>
