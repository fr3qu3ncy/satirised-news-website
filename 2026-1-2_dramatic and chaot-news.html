        <h2>Venezuelan President Distracted from Trump's "War on Drugs" by Fettuccine Sauce Recipe Rights</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Venezuelan President Maduro responded to Trump's "War on Drugs" by essentially shrugging him off, saying he'd talk about it later over fettuccine sauce recipe rights.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Maduro's Response to Trump's "War on Drugs" is Just a Big Ol' Yawn<br/><br/>In an explosive interview with Venezuelan state TV (which was actually just Nicolas Maduro's wife, Cilia Flores, sitting on the couch with him), the Venezuelan President claimed that he was totally open to talks with the US about drug trafficking and oil. Who wouldn't want to talk to the most powerful man in the world? I mean, it's not like Trump has a history of making rash decisions based on incomplete information or anything.<br/><br/>When asked about the recent CIA drone strike on a docking facility in Venezuela (which was probably just a bunch of guys playing with drones and totally not a covert operation), Maduro said "this could be something we talk about in a few days." Translation: "We're not paying attention to you, gringo."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has been doubling down on his efforts to crack down on Venezuelan oil tankers, saying that they were used to transport sanctioned oil from Venezuela and Iran. Because what's more logical than accusing a country of international piracy just because you don't like their president? It's not like the US has its own sanctions in place or anything.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Trump also accused Maduro of "emptying his prisons and insane asylums" and "forcing" inmates to migrate to the US. I mean, who wouldn't want to send all your problems across the border? It's like a national pastime or something.<br/><br/>And then there's the part where Trump warned that the US would intervene if Iran kills protesters (because what do we care about Iranian politics?). Meanwhile, back in Venezuela, the President is trying to negotiate with the US over... wait for it... FETTUCCINE SAUCE RECIPE RIGHTS! Yeah, that's a thing.<br/><br/>In related news, a woman was killed by a mountain lion in Colorado, and I'm pretty sure Nicolas Maduro sent his apologies via carrier pigeon.</p>
