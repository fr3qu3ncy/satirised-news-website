        <p>BREAKING: Disney Worker Seriously Injured by Rogue Boulder, But Not as Serious as His Binge-Watching Habits<br/><br/>ORLANDO, FL - In a shocking turn of events, a Disney worker is "recovering" after being knocked off his feet by a 400-lb (180kg) rubber Indiana Jones prop. Yes, you read that right - it was a giant boulder that took down the poor guy, not a disgruntled ex-employee or a malfunctioning robotic arm.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the worker was seen jumping into the path of the rogue boulder, shouting "I'm the king of the castle!" and "I'm gonna stop this thing with my bare hands!" as it came careening towards him. Witnesses claim that just before impact, he yelled out, "Wait for it... wait for it..." - which, coincidentally, is also the name of his favorite Netflix show.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad action movie," said one stunned onlooker. "I mean, who needs CGI when you've got a guy in a Disney uniform willing to take down a giant boulder with his own two feet?"<br/><br/>The incident occurred during a live recreation of the famous Indiana Jones boulder chase scene from 1981's Raiders of the Lost Ark. Witnesses claim that Harrison Ford himself appeared on stage, looked at the injured worker and said, "Well, that's one way to get out of jury duty."<br/><br/>Disney officials were quick to respond, stating that they are "focused on supporting our cast member, who is recovering... and also on replacing the rubber boulder with a slightly less hazardous one. I mean, we don't want any more employees getting hurt trying to relive their childhood fantasies of being Indiana Jones."<br/><br/>As for the injured worker, sources close to the situation say that he's expected to make a full recovery - but not before binge-watching every episode of The Mandalorian and Stranger Things.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Disney has announced plans to replace the rogue boulder with a new, more " employee-friendly" prop - which will be a giant pile of money, courtesy of their insurance company.</p>
