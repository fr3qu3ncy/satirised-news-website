        <p>"MALI AND BURKINA FASO PUT KIBOSH ON US VISITORS IN RECURSIVE MOVE"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Mali and Burkina Faso have decided to ban all American citizens from entering their countries. Because, you know, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade... and then impose travel restrictions on the entire nation that gave them those lemons.<br/><br/>The decision comes after President Donald Trump's administration imposed full-entry restrictions on citizens of Mali, Burkina Faso, South Sudan, Syria, and Palestine (but not Nigeria, because, priorities). The US move was met with a collective shrug from the international community, which was already too busy watching cat videos to care.<br/><br/>In response, Mali's foreign ministry put out a statement that read: "We regret that the United States did not consult us on this decision. It's like they didn't even know we existed." Meanwhile, Burkina Faso's foreign affairs minister Karamoko Jean-Marie Traoré said his government was simply acting on the "principle of reciprocity"... and also because their countries' soccer teams had a bad rivalry going on with the US.<br/><br/>The restrictions will supposedly be lifted once these West African nations show "credible improvements" in identity management, information-sharing, and cooperation with US immigration authorities. In other words, they need to get their act together, which is totally not what's happening at all right now.<br/><br/>As for Niger, it's unclear if they'll also join the travel ban party, but sources close to the country's state news agency say they're "totally considering it" (just kidding, that never happens).<br/><br/>In a separate development, President Trump has been spotted wearing a "I Banned Mali" t-shirt while having breakfast at McDonald's. His response to the situation? A simple: "Fake news! My travel ban is the best!"</p>
