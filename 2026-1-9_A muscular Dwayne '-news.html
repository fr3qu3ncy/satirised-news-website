        <p>BREAKING: US Seizes Another Oil Tanker in Caribbean, This Time With a Cameo by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has seized yet another oil tanker linked to Venezuela's sanctions list. But this time, it's not just any ordinary seizure – Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has been spotted on board, flexing his pecs and yelling "Can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?" as he helped US Marines apprehend the vessel.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the operation, the tanker, Olina, was attempting to break through the US naval blockade in the Caribbean when it was intercepted by a team of elite commandos. As the crew attempted to flee in their lifeboats, The Rock appeared out of nowhere, riding on the back of a giant dolphin and shouting "You're not going anywhere, amigos!"<br/><br/>The Rock, who was reportedly on a break from filming his next movie, "Fast 10: Electric Dreams," said he had been recruited by the US military for his expertise in... well, everything. "I mean, have you seen my IMDb page?" he quipped. "I'm like a superhero, but instead of powers, I've got charisma and brawn."<br/><br/>The seized tanker, Olina, is allegedly part of Venezuela's infamous "dark fleet" – a group of over 1,000 vessels that transport sanctioned and illicit oil around the world. But don't worry, folks – The Rock has assured us that he's on top of it. "Don't you worry, I've got this," he said with a wink. "I'll have those tankers so shell-shocked, they'll be begging for mercy."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuelan officials are outraged at the seizure, claiming it's just another example of US imperialism. "We're not going to let The Rock and his gang just waltz in here and start taking our oil," said a spokesperson for President Nicolás Maduro. "We'll have you know that we've got our own special forces – they're called the 'Maduro Mugs'!"<br/><br/>Update: Just as this article was going to press, word came in that The Rock has been promoted to General by US Secretary of Defense Lloyd Austin, citing his exceptional leadership skills and ability to "crush it on a Tuesday." When asked about the promotion, Johnson simply smiled and said, "It's not just any Tuesday – it's #TankerTuesday!"<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* "US Seizes Two 'Shadow Fleet' Tankers Linked to Venezuelan Oil"<br/>* "Trump Says Venezuela Will Be 'Turning Over' Up to 50 Million Barrels of Oil to US"<br/>* "More Economical to Demolish East Wing Than Renovate, White House Says"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
