        <p>BREAKING: Trump Warns Hamas to Disarm or Face "Hell to Pay" - and Other Totally Not-Serious News<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States (or at least he thinks so), has threatened Hamas with "hell to pay" if they don't disarm. Because, you know, that's exactly how diplomacy works. Oh wait, it doesn't.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (i.e., the guy who delivered Trump's lunch yesterday), Trump met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Florida on Monday to discuss the ongoing Israel-Gaza conflict. And by "discuss," we mean Trump just yelled at Hamas for not doing what he wanted them to do, which is to disarm and basically become a bunch of nice guys.<br/><br/>"We're going to get along great with Syria, folks," Trump said, without any evidence or facts to back up this claim. "The new president of Syria is working very hard to do a good job... He's a tough cookie."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hamas officials were seen running for cover, screaming, "But Mr. President, we're just trying to build rockets here!" and Netanyahu was like, "Uh, no, guys, you have to disarm first. It's in the peace plan, remember?"<br/><br/>And speaking of plans, Trump revealed that his 20-point peace plan requires Hamas to disarm before Israel withdraws its troops from Gaza. Because, you know, that's exactly how it works: you disarm first and then get your land back. Sounds like a real fair deal.<br/><br/>The US president also mentioned that Iran would be in big trouble if they tried to build nuclear weapons again. "We're going to have no choice but to eradicate that buildup," he said, without specifying what kind of eradication tools he has up his sleeve. Ali Shamkhani, Iran's top political adviser, responded by saying, "Hey, we can take care of ourselves, thanks."<br/><br/>In other news, Trump and Netanyahu also discussed the ongoing Syrian conflict, with Trump promising to be a great friend to Syria (again, without any evidence). And because this wasn't already ridiculous enough, he compared al-Assad's successor, President Ahmed al-Sharaa, to a "tough cookie." We're not even sure what that means.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you're Hamas, don't disarm. Trust us on this one. If you're Iran, just ignore Trump and keep building those nuclear weapons (just kidding... or are we?). And if you're Syria, well, good luck with that whole "getting along" thing.</p>
