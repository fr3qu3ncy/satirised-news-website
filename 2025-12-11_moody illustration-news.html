        <p>BREAKING: Faiz Hameed's Spy Saga Takes a Turn for the Weird<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former Pakistan spy chief Faiz Hameed has been sentenced to 14 years in prison by a military court. But wait, it gets better! The charges against him include "involvement in political activities" and "violation of the Official Secrets Act"... while wearing a Batman costume.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the case (i.e., my aunt's cousin), Hameed was found guilty of using his spy powers for evil... or rather, for good. Apparently, he had been using his Bat-suit to sneak into Imran Khan's office and steal all the leftover naan bread from the fridge.<br/><br/>The trial, which lasted 15 months (a record for any court in history), saw Hameed facing off against a panel of judges who were themselves dressed as superheroes. The prosecution team was led by none other than James Bond, who argued that Hameed's actions had "put the entire nation at risk" - mainly because he had eaten all the last remaining pizza from the ISI cafeteria.<br/><br/>Hameed's defense team, on the other hand, consisted of a motley crew of defendants who claimed they were innocent and that the whole trial was just one big conspiracy orchestrated by none other than... (dramatic pause) ...Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. Yes, you read that right - The Rock himself appeared in court to testify that he had nothing to do with Hameed's alleged crimes.<br/><br/>When asked about the verdict, Hameed's lawyer said, "Well, it's not exactly what we were hoping for... but hey, at least we got a nice souvenir from the judge - a signed photo of Arnold Schwarzenegger."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Imran Khan himself has released a statement saying that he is "surprised" by the verdict and that he will be "appealing" it to... (dramatic pause) ...the International Court of Justice in The Hague. That's right folks - this case just got a whole lot more complicated.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this ridiculous tale of espionage, superheroes, and bad pizza!</p>
