        <p>BREAKING: Fergal Keane's Face Has Met Thousands of Traumatised Children, But His Beard Has Not Been Affected<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, award-winning journalist Fergal Keane has revealed that his face has been exposed to thousands of traumatised children while reporting on conflicts. However, in a bizarre twist, his beard has miraculously remained unaffected.<br/><br/>Keane, who has spent nearly four decades reporting on wars and conflicts, has met dozens of children who have been evacuated from Gaza for medical treatment. Among them is Abdelrahman, an 11-year-old boy who lost his leg to an Israeli air strike. "He started pulling his hair and hitting himself hard," says Asma al-Nashash, Abdelrahman's mum. "He became like someone who has depression, seeing his friends playing and running around… and he's sitting alone." Wait, what? Wasn't that just a scene from "The Breakfast Club"?<br/><br/>When asked about the impact of war on children's minds, Keane consulted with Professor Theresa Betancourt, author of Shadows into Light. She explained that trauma has an impact that lasts long into the future, affecting the developing architecture of the brain in young children, and resulting in lifelong consequences for learning, behaviour, and both physical and mental health. Oh no, it sounds like a bad episode of "The Walking Dead"!<br/><br/>But fear not, dear readers! For Fergal Keane has a solution to this global crisis: his beard. That's right, folks; Keane believes that his majestic beard can somehow magically heal the traumatised children he's met. When asked for an explanation, Keane simply shrugged and said, "It's just one of those things."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in unrelated news, a group of chimpanzees have been spotted wearing tiny suits and sunglasses in the Congo. They're reportedly trying to start their own conflict reporting agency, with Fergal Keane as their CEO.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The United Nations has issued a statement confirming that they are indeed searching for a new Secretary-General – one who is willing to grow a beard like Fergal Keane's.<br/><br/>SIDE BAR:<br/><br/>* Fergal Keane's face has been seen in more conflicts than Tom Hanks has been seen in movies.<br/>* The average age of the children Keane has met is 12, which is also the average age of a typical teenager with acne.<br/>* If you have PTSD, don't worry; just wear a beard like Fergal Keane's and you'll be cured in no time!</p>
