        <p>PUTIN SAYS NO MORE WARS, BUT ONLY IF WE TREAT HIM WITH RESPECT... AND GIVE HIM OUR LUNCH MONEY<br/><br/>Moscow, Russia - In a shocking turn of events, Vladimir Putin has vowed to never again start a war with Europe... as long as we treat him with the respect and admiration that he so clearly deserves. The Russian leader made this announcement during an exclusive interview with BBC's Steve Rosenberg, where he also insisted on getting his favorite snack, caviar-topped pizza.<br/><br/>"It's not about invading Ukraine or flying fighter jets over European airspace," Putin said with a straight face. "It's just about feeling good about ourselves and being treated like the supreme leader that I am."<br/><br/>Rosenberg, who was visibly shaken during the interview, asked Putin if he was prepared to abandon his plans for a special military operation in Europe. To which Putin replied, "Well, actually, I was thinking of calling it 'Operation: Caviar Surprise'. But only if you agree to give me all your caviar. I mean, who doesn't love caviar, right?"<br/><br/>When asked about the recent allegations that Russia had been engaging in cyber-attacks and sabotage on European soil, Putin simply shrugged and said, "Oh, those? Just a little creative expression, darling. Like, you know, when someone leaves their dirty socks on the floor."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, European leaders are still trying to wrap their heads around Putin's sudden change of heart. "We're not sure if we should be relieved or concerned," said EU President Antonio Costa. "I mean, it's great that he wants to stop invading us, but what about all the times he's invaded our personal space with his awkward hugs and endless talks about Russian hockey?"<br/><br/>In related news, Putin has announced plans to establish a new holiday, 'Caviar Appreciation Day', where Russians will be encouraged to eat as much caviar as possible in honor of their beloved leader.</p>
