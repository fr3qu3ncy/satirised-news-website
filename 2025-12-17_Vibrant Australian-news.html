        <p>BREAKING: "Bondi Rabbi" Schlanger's Funeral Turns into Wild Party<br/><br/>Sydney, Australia - In a shocking turn of events, the funeral of beloved Rabbi Eli Schlanger turned into an impromptu rave party yesterday evening. Thousands of mourners gathered to bid farewell to the "Bondi Rabbi," who was killed in the recent Bondi Beach shooting alongside 14 others.<br/><br/>As the coffin bearing Rabbi Schlanger's body made its way through the streets, a surprise DJ booth suddenly appeared out of nowhere, blasting a remix of the Macarena. The crowd, caught off guard, couldn't help but start dancing and singing along to the catchy tune.<br/><br/>"It was like a Jewish-Australian Mardi Gras!" exclaimed local resident and party attendee, Barry Goldberg. "Who wouldn't want to celebrate the life of this amazing Rabbi with some tunes?"<br/><br/>The funeral procession, led by Rabbi Ulman (Schlanger's father-in-law), who was overcome with emotion and had tears streaming down his face, eventually made its way to the Bondi Beach where a giant menorah stood tall. However, instead of lighting the candles as tradition dictates, partygoers lit up a massive bonfire while chanting "We will survive!"<br/><br/>"We're not going to let terrorism bring us down," said Rabbi Ulman, trying to regain composure amidst the chaos. "We'll just dance it off and hope no one gets arrested for disorderly conduct."<br/><br/>As the night wore on, party attendees began to get a little too wild. Someone brought out a mariachi band, playing an impromptu rendition of "La Cucaracha" while waving fake mustaches in the air. Others started doing keg stands on the beachfront promenade.<br/><br/>Even Prime Minister Anthony Albanese couldn't resist joining in on the fun, busting out some questionable dance moves to impress the crowd. When asked about his impromptu performance, he simply shrugged and said, "Hey, when in Rome... or Bondi Beach, for that matter."<br/><br/>The party continued until the early hours of the morning, with many attendees still going strong even as the sun began to rise over the Sydney skyline.<br/><br/>"It was like a once-in-a-lifetime experience," said local resident, Karen Lee. "I mean, who needs therapy when you can just dance it out on Bondi Beach?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rabbi Schlanger's family released a statement expressing their gratitude for the outpouring of love and support from the community. However, they did politely request that in future gatherings, everyone please refrain from bringing out the accordion.<br/><br/>In related news, Naveed Akram, the alleged gunman behind the Bondi Beach shooting, has been charged with 59 offenses, including 15 counts of murder and one count of being a general party pooper.</p>
