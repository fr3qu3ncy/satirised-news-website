        <p>BREAKING: Trump Threatens Colombia with Military Action, Petrol Prices Rise 10 Cents Per Gallon<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Donald Trump has threatened to invade Colombia, sparking widespread panic among locals and an increase in petrol prices. As tensions rise, Colombian President Gustavo Petro took to the BBC to express his concerns.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what's going on here," said Petro, sporting a pair of novelty shades. "One minute it's 'Make America Great Again,' the next it's 'Let's Invade Colombia and Make Them Pay for Our Roads.' I mean, what's up with that?"<br/><br/>Trump, meanwhile, has been seen practicing his invasion speeches in front of a mirror, shouting "You're gonna get invaded, you're gonna get invaded!" while flailing his arms like a deranged chicken.<br/><br/>As the situation unfolds, Colombian citizens are taking to the streets, protesting against Trump's plans. Demonstrators can be seen holding signs that read "No War! No Ice Cream!" and chanting slogans such as "Hey, hey, ho, ho! ICE has got to go!"<br/><br/>The Colombian military, meanwhile, is gearing up for battle by stocking up on copious amounts of coffee and listening to traditional folk music.<br/><br/>"We're not afraid of the US army," said a Colombian general, puffing on a cigar. "We've got our mountains, our jungles, and our questionable driving skills on our side."<br/><br/>Petro, meanwhile, has invited Venezuela's acting president Delcy Rodríguez to Colombia for some friendly diplomacy over a plate of arepas. Trump, predictably, has responded by tweeting "Bad news, folks! They're just trying to distract us from their failing oil industry!"<br/><br/>As the world holds its breath, one thing is certain: if there's one thing that can unite Colombia and Venezuela, it's their shared hatred of Donald Trump.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The White House has released a statement saying that Trump's invasion plans are "totally not happening" and that he was just joking around with his buddies in the Oval Office. Yeah right.<br/><br/>ANALYSIS: In related news, petrol prices have risen 10 cents per gallon, and sales of novelty shades have skyrocketed. It's anyone's guess what will happen next, but one thing is for sure: it'll be a wild ride!</p>
