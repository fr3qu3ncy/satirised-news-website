        <p>BREAKING: Venezuelan Interim Leader Sacks General Who Failed to Protect Maduro's Hairpieces<br/><br/>CARACAS, VENEZUELA - In a shocking move, Venezuela's interim leader Delcy Rodríguez has sacked General Javier Marcano Tábata, the commander of the inner circle of guards tasked with protecting President Nicolás Maduro's hairpieces. Yes, you read that right - hairpieces.<br/><br/>Sources close to the Venezuelan government confirm that Gen Marcano Tábata was in charge of ensuring Maduro's toupees were properly secured and styled at all times, a task he failed miserably at when US forces stormed the presidential palace and seized the Venezuelan leader.<br/><br/>"It's not just about protecting the President," said Rodríguez in a statement. "It's also about protecting his hairdos. I mean, have you seen Maduro's mullet? It's a masterpiece."<br/><br/>The sacking of Gen Marcano Tábata has sent shockwaves throughout the Venezuelan military, with many questioning how someone could so thoroughly fail to protect Maduro's prized possessions.<br/><br/>"It's like he was trying to get fired," said one soldier, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, who lets US forces storm the palace and seize the President without so much as a fight? It's like he wanted to get sacked."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, sources close to the Trump administration have confirmed that they are indeed considering turning Venezuela into a giant Taco Bell restaurant, complete with a drive-thru window and a " Nacho Average Government" slogan.<br/><br/>"We're thinking of making Venezuela the 51st state," said a spokesperson for the President. "And by 'state,' I mean 'Taco Bell franchise.' It's going to be huge, believe me."<br/><br/>In related news, Cuba has announced that it is recalling all its nationals from Venezuela and replacing them with a team of highly trained Cuban hairdressers.<br/><br/>"We're not just going to protect Maduro's hairpieces," said one Cuban official. "We're going to make sure they look fabulous while we do it."</p>
