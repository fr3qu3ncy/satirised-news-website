        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Resort BANS Pyrotechnics After Bar Fire, Owners Face Charges<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the Swiss canton of Valais has banned pyrotechnic devices in all indoor public venues after a devastating fire at a ski resort bar killed 40 people and injured 116 others. But that's not all - the authorities have also decided to replace all the foam padding on the ceiling with actual clouds, because, why not?<br/><br/>The blaze is believed to have started when sparklers attached to champagne bottles set light to... well, actually, it just set light to everything. Because, you know, sparklers are just a great idea in enclosed spaces.<br/><br/>The two owners of the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, are facing charges of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence, and arson by negligence. Their defense? "We were just trying to create a festive atmosphere!" Yeah, that's exactly what the coroner said when he autopsied all those poor souls.<br/><br/>In related news, the ski resort has also been renamed "Crans-Montana: Where Your Pyrotechnic Dreams Come True... and Burn Down".<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Swiss authorities have announced an emergency payment of 10,000 francs to each victim's family. And by "emergency payment", we mean a really nice coupon book with discounts on fondue and raclette.<br/><br/>The investigation into the fire has revealed some shocking facts - including that the bar had not undergone safety checks in five years. Oh wait, no they hadn't. They were too busy making snowmen out of the sound-insulating foam padding to worry about safety protocols.<br/><br/>MEANWHILE: The French government has issued a statement saying, "Zut! We are shocked and saddened by this tragedy. But let's be real, it's not like we haven't had worse things happen in our history... like that time we accidentally set fire to the Louvre".<br/><br/>As the people of Crans-Montana struggle to come to terms with their new reality, one thing is certain - nobody will ever look at a sparkler the same way again.<br/><br/>SIDEBAR: In related news, the local bakery has announced a special deal on champagne bottle-shaped croissants. Just kidding (or are we?).</p>
