        <p>"Sea-rious" Situation: Dozens Missing After Boat Sinks Off Gambia, But Don't Worry, SpongeBob and Patrick Are on the Case!"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, a boat carrying 200 migrants attempting to reach Spain's Canary Islands has sunk off the coast of The Gambia. The incident has left at least seven people dead and dozens missing, but all hope is not lost... for it's been reported that SpongeBob SquarePants and his trusty sidekick Patrick Star are on their way to the scene in a giant pineapple boat.<br/><br/>"We've got this under control," said SpongeBob, donning his best lifeguard hat. "Patrick, go get some Krabby Patties from the food truck – we're gonna need them for all these hungry migrants."<br/><br/>As the search and rescue operation continues, authorities have confirmed that the sunken vessel was a large wooden canoe not designed for transatlantic journeys. In fact, it was more like a giant rubber ducky than a sturdy ship.<br/><br/>"This is a classic case of 'try or die'," said one migrant, who wished to remain anonymous. "We thought we'd never make it to Spain, but then SpongeBob showed up and everything's cool now."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the European Union has issued a statement expressing their disappointment at the incident, saying that they had reached agreements with several North African countries to reduce irregular migration. But it seems those agreements didn't quite work out as planned.<br/><br/>In related news, a group of wild flamingos have been spotted flying overhead, flapping their wings and squawking "No! No! No!" in unison. When asked for comment, they simply said, "We're just here for the Krabby Patties – we heard they were to die for."<br/><br/>Update: SpongeBob and Patrick have successfully rescued 96 people from the sunken vessel and are now on their way to Spain with a cargo hold full of delicious Krabby Patties. The remaining migrants are still missing, but all hope is not lost – after all, as SpongeBob would say, "I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready!"</p>
