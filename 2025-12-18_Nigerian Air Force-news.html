        <p>BREAKING: Nigerian Air Force Personnel Still MIA, but Not Because They're Hiding from Their Spouses<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Nigerian air force personnel who were detained in Burkina Faso after their plane made an unauthorized landing have still not returned home. But don't worry, it's not because they're trying to escape their spouses' nagging about doing the dishes.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (i.e., a random guy on Twitter), the pilots and crew members are actually stuck in Burkina Faso because they got lost on the way back from a secret mission to fetch some decent jollof rice. "We were supposed to fly to Portugal, but then we saw this amazing Nigerian restaurant on our route," said one of the pilots, who wished to remain anonymous (but is actually DJ Khaled). "Next thing you know, we're stuck in Burkina Faso, and our wives are all like 'what's taking so long?'"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre twist, the Burkinabè military has been accused of using Nigerian Air Force personnel as extras in their latest propaganda film. When asked about this, Captain Ibrahim Traoré, the leader of the Burkinabè military, simply shrugged and said, "Hey, they're just trying to get some experience for their resumes, right?"<br/><br/>Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Tuggar has apologized for the whole ordeal, but only after being forced to by his wife, who threatened to take away his PlayStation privileges if he didn't. "Sorry, sorry, it was all a big mistake!" said Tuggar, while nervously glancing over his shoulder.<br/><br/>And in related news, the Nigerian Air Force has announced that they will be launching a new reality TV show called "Survivor: Burkina Faso," where contestants will have to survive on nothing but plantains and water for 30 days. Because what's more realistic than that?<br/><br/>Update: The Nigerian air force personnel have still not returned home, but sources close to the matter (i.e., a random guy on Twitter) say they're actually having the time of their lives in Burkina Faso, dancing to Afrobeat music and eating all the jollof rice they can get.</p>
