        <p>The Ukrainian leader says he is "determined" to continue working with US, as Russian strikes continue... but there's a twist<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that he's determined to keep working with the United States on a peace plan, despite Russia's continued bombardment of Ukraine. But wait, it gets even better! Zelensky made this statement while wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and holding a giant novelty hammer.<br/><br/>"It's time for some real talk, folks," said Zelensky, his eyes gleaming with determination. "We're not just talking about peace – we're talking about construction! And who better to help us build that peace than our good friends in the US?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has responded to Zelensky's announcement by saying that he's still not interested in playing nice. "We'll just keep bombing them," said Putin, munching on a bag of chips. "It's like when I'm watching TV and someone gets too close to my snack – gotta defend it, you know?"<br/><br/>But what about the US? Well, President Joe Biden has come out in support of Zelensky's peace plan, but only if it involves more nacho cheese. "We're all for peace, but let's be real, folks," said Biden. "If we can get a good deal on some top-shelf nacho cheese, then maybe – just maybe – we'll consider backing this whole thing."<br/><br/>In other news, Ukrainian officials have been spotted sipping margaritas in Miami as they negotiate with US diplomats to finalize the peace plan. When asked about the margaritas, one official said, "Hey, someone's gotta keep things lively around here! And besides, we're not just talking about peace – we're talking about a good time!"<br/><br/>As for Steve Witkoff, Donald Trump's peace envoy, he was seen walking into a meeting with Zelensky while eating a whole pizza by himself. When asked about the pizza, Witkoff said, "Hey, when you're negotiating world peace, you need fuel – and what better fuel than a good slice of pizza?"<br/><br/>And finally, in related news, Vladimir Putin has been spotted arguing with his cat over who gets to control the remote control for Netflix. When asked about this, Putin simply shrugged and said, "It's just a cat-astrophic situation, folks."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story – we'll be sure to bring you all the juicy details as they happen!</p>
