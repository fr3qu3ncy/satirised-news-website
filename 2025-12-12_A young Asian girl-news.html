        <p>Young People Tell BBC That Military-Style Schools Are A Bunch Of BS, And Also Abuse Students They Claim To Help<br/><br/> Ahhahahaha! Welcome to the most epic news story of the century, folks! We've got a real doozy for you today, straight from the crazy world of Chinese military-style schools. So, it turns out that these "schools" are actually just places where they take your kids, lock them up, and beat them into submission... or so they claim.<br/><br/>Baobao's Story: A Real-Life Hunger Games<br/><br/>Meet Baobao, a 19-year-old who spent six months at one of these fancy schools. She says it was like being trapped in the Hunger Games, but with more beating and less Katniss. Baobao claims that she was constantly on edge, fearful for her safety, and forced to participate in extreme physical exercise (think: CrossFit on steroids). Oh, and did I mention that she was also groped by a school staff member? Classy.<br/><br/>Undercover Footage Reveals The Truth<br/><br/>We've got undercover footage of the school, folks! It's like something out of a bad sci-fi movie. Students are locked in their dorms, with CCTV cameras monitoring every move they make. And get this - staff members are impersonating officials from the "internet regulator" to abduct students and take them to the school. Yeah, because that's totally not suspicious at all.<br/><br/>Li Zheng: The Mastermind Behind This Madness<br/><br/>Meet Li Zheng, the mastermind behind these military-style schools. He's a military veteran who thought it'd be cool to start his own "education" empire, where he can torture and abuse kids with impunity. I mean, who wouldn't want to send their kids to a school where they're beaten and traumatized?<br/><br/>The Chinese Embassy Weighs In<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Chinese embassy has weighed in on this whole debacle, saying that all educational institutions are required to comply with regulations. Yeah, good luck with that.<br/><br/>Baobao's Mom: The Ultimate Enabler<br/><br/>And finally, we've got Baobao's mom, who's basically the ultimate enabler. She took Baobao to the school because she was worried about her behavior (read: she didn't want to deal with it anymore). And then she paid 40,000 yuan ($5,700; £4,300) for six months of "education" that consisted solely of physical abuse and emotional trauma. Good job, mom!<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The shocking truth about China's military-style schools, where they take your kids, beat them up, and call it "education."</p>
