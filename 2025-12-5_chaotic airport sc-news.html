    <div class="article">
        <p>INDI GO, INDIA'S LARGEST CARRIER, HAS SAID OPERATIONS WILL RETURN TO FULL NORMALCY ONLY BY 10 FEBRUARY... BUT WHY SO SLOW?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, IndiGo, India's largest airline, has announced that their operations will return to full normalcy only by 10 February. Yes, you read that right - 10 February! It's like they're trying to give the entire country a permanent case of Monday blues.<br/><br/>Apparently, the airline is facing pilot shortages due to their inability to adapt to new crew rostering rules. You know, the usual - "oops, we forgot to schedule our pilots properly, let alone the planes themselves". It's like they thought they were running a magic show instead of an actual airline!<br/><br/>Thousands of passengers are left stranded across India, with all IndiGo flights from Delhi cancelled. Can you imagine the looks on their faces when they showed up at the airport and found out that all their flights had been cancelled? "Honey, I'm sorry, but it seems we're not going anywhere today... or this week... or possibly next month..." Talk about a wedding crasher!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Singapore's High Commissioner to India, Simon Wong, was spotted at Delhi's Indira Gandhi International Airport, looking lost and confused. When asked what he was doing there, he replied, "I'm here for the wedding of my young staff member, but I think we're all just going to have to reschedule... again."<br/><br/>In related news, a tiger that was supposed to attend the wedding has been arrested in connection with trafficking tiger parts. Who knew? But that's a whole different story...<br/><br/>So, there you have it - IndiGo's operations will return to full normalcy by 10 February. Meanwhile, passengers will just have to keep on keeping on... or in this case, keeping on waiting.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the government has issued an advisory asking passengers to check the status of their flights before heading to the airport. Because, you know, it's not like they have better things to do than stand in line for hours only to find out that their flight is cancelled... again!<br/><br/>And finally, we'd like to offer some advice to all those stranded passengers: "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But when life gives you a cancelled flight and a bunch of other airlines' staff trying to help you, just grab a snack from the nearest food cart and pretend everything is okay..."</p>
