        <p>BREAKING: Australia Bans Social Media for Under 16s, But Who Cares?<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left everyone in the country utterly unbothered, the Australian government has announced that social media will be banned for anyone under the age of 16 from December 10th. Because what could possibly go wrong with a bunch of hormonal teenagers being forced to interact with each other face-to-face?<br/><br/>The BBC's own Katy Watson, resplendent in her wetsuit and snorkelling goggles, was out on the streets of Sydney asking young people aged between 18 and 20 what they thought about this new policy. And let's just say it was a real thrill-ride.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure why they're bothering," said one young person, who wished to remain anonymous because, honestly, who wants to be seen talking to the BBC? "I mean, I've already got my Instagram and TikTok followers sorted out by now. A ban is just going to make me more popular, right?"<br/><br/>Katy Watson: "Er, no, actually, it's meant to protect you from cyberbullying and online harm."<br/><br/>Young Person: "Oh yeah, sure. That's why I've been screenshotting all the mean comments about my haircut on Instagram for years. It's just a natural part of growing up, innit?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a nearby park, a group of teenagers were seen playing with a giant stick insect and laughing uproariously at its flared wings. When asked about the social media ban, one of them looked up from their phone (which they were using to take a selfie with said stick insect) and said:<br/><br/>"Dude, who cares? It's not like we're going to suddenly become responsible or anything. We'll just find other ways to be annoying online, I guess."<br/><br/>As Katy Watson walked away, she bumped into none other than Peter Falconio (RIP), Joanne Lees' ex-boyfriend and the man at the centre of one of Australia's most infamous murders. He was seen sipping a cold beer and chatting with some mates.<br/><br/>"Hey, mate," he said to Katy. "Don't mind the social media ban. We've got more important things on our minds... like who ate the last of my KFC chicken sandwich."<br/><br/>And so, it seems, life will go on in Australia as usual – completely unaffected by this supposed 'ban' on social media for under-16s.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* "Teenager Arrested for Using Too Much Cheesecake in a Sentence"<br/>* "Katy Watson Accidentally Films Herself Getting Stuck in a Tree While Trying to Get the Perfect Snorkelling Shot"<br/>* "Australian Politician Bob Katter Admits to Punching People for Mentioning His Lebanese Heritage"</p>
