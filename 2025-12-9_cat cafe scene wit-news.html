        <p>BREAKING: Authorities Warn of Stronger Tremor, Citizens Urged to Remain Calm and Carry On... with a Nice Cuppa<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, authorities in Japan have warned that a stronger tremor could occur in the coming days, leaving citizens scrambling for their nearest cat cafe. Yes, you read that right - cat cafes.<br/><br/>As the news broke, people were seen rushing to their local feline hangouts, desperate for some comfort and a decent cup of coffee. "I mean, what's the point of having a panic room if you can't have a nice latte while waiting for the apocalypse?" said one citizen, sipping on a cappuccino.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Japanese government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre, staffed by a team of highly trained hamsters in tiny uniforms. "We're doing everything we can to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures," said Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi, who was spotted playing Pokémon Go on her phone during the press conference.<br/><br/>The authorities have also warned citizens to remain on high alert for at least a week, or until the next major sporting event. "We don't want anyone to miss the Japan vs. Australia rugby match," said a spokesperson. "That would be just disastrous."<br/><br/>In related news, thousands of homes have been left without power, but residents are assured that it's not as bad as it sounds - they can still watch Netflix on their phones using their solar-powered cat chargers.<br/><br/>As for the Aomori prefectural government's evacuation orders, officials have promised to provide warm and fuzzy blankets to all those affected. "We want everyone to feel safe and cozy while waiting for the 'big one' to hit," said a spokesperson.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, the Japanese electric company Tohoku Electric Power has reported no irregularities at its Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants, which is just as well because the workers are all on holiday in Hawaii.<br/><br/>And finally, citizens have been advised to secure their furniture and prepare to evacuate immediately if they feel shaking - or if they see a Pikachu.</p>
