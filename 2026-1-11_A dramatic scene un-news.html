        <p>BREAKING: "The Deal Was Announced in the Early Hours of Sunday Morning After a Week of Violent Clashes... and a Surprise Guest Appearance by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF) have finally withdrawn from the besieged city of Aleppo, following the announcement of a ceasefire deal in the early hours of Sunday morning. But here's the kicker: just as the last SDF fighters were about to leave, a loud "Can you smell what The Rock is cookin'?" echoed through the streets, followed by the unmistakable sight of Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, clad in a leather jacket and sporting his signature raised eyebrow.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, The Rock suddenly appeared out of nowhere, arms wide open, and proclaimed: "It's time for peace, folks! And also, can someone please get me a selfie with these guys?" As the stunned SDF fighters stared at him in confusion, The Rock proceeded to take a series of awkward photos with them, making everyone laugh.<br/><br/>As the chaos ensued, Mazloum Abdi, leader of the Kurdish-led SDF, looked on in bewilderment and muttered: "Uh, I think we can safely say this isn't part of our negotiation strategy." Meanwhile, a bemused-looking Tom Barrack, US ambassador to Turkey and special envoy to Syria, was overheard whispering to himself: "Well, this is one way to break the ice..."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, The Rock then proceeded to offer an impromptu motivational speech to the remaining SDF fighters, yelling: "You guys are like the People's Champ of war! You fought hard, you fought proud... now go home and get some sleep, because tomorrow is another day!" As the crowd dispersed in disarray, it was unclear whether The Rock's antics would actually help to broker a lasting peace.<br/><br/>The ceasefire deal itself was brokered via international mediation, securing the safe evacuation of "martyrs, the wounded, the trapped civilians and the fighters" from the city. However, sources close to the negotiations hinted that things got complicated when someone (rumored to be The Rock) accidentally knocked over a tray of freshly baked Syrian pastries during a crucial meeting.<br/><br/>With tensions easing, Turkey's President Recep Tayyip Erdogan was spotted sipping tea with his counterparts and muttering: "Well, I suppose this is one way to get the world to focus on Aleppo... but next time, can we please just stick to the usual protocol?"</p>
