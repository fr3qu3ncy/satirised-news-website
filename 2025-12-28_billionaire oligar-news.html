        <p>Western Sanctions Have Failed to Turn Billionaires into Opponents; Putin's Policies Have Turned Them into Silent Backers<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russia's billionaires have not only survived but thrived under Vladimir Putin's leadership. Despite Western sanctions and a massive decline in the value of their wealth, they have remained eerily silent on the war with Ukraine.<br/><br/>It seems that Putin's carrot-and-stick approach has worked like a charm. For those who dare to criticize the war, there are consequences - as seen in the case of Oleg Tinkov, whose bank was nationalized and sold for pennies on the dollar after he made a snarky comment about the war being "crazy" on Instagram.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Putin's loyal billionaires have been raking it in. In fact, this year saw the highest ever number of billionaires in Russia - 140, with a collective worth of $580 billion, just $3 billion shy of the all-time high registered before the invasion.<br/><br/>It's like they say: "you can't keep a good oligarch down." And Putin has made sure to keep them on his side by showering them with benefits and lucrative contracts. Who needs democracy when you have defense contracts?<br/><br/>But what about those who refuse to play along? Well, take the case of Mikhail Khodorkovsky, Russia's richest man at one point, but now a mere memory after being sent to jail for 10 years for his pro-democracy activism.<br/><br/>It seems that Putin has a special place in hell reserved for those who dare to defy him. But hey, at least he's consistent - and so are the billionaires, who have stayed quiet as church mice on the war with Ukraine.<br/><br/>Putin's War Economy: Where Billionaires Reign Supreme<br/><br/>So what's behind this phenomenon? According to Forbes's Wealth team, it's simple: Putin's war economy has created a bonanza of opportunities for Russia's ultra-rich. Lavish spending on the war has spurred economic growth of more than 4% a year in Russia in 2023 and 2024.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the benefits for those who aren't directly involved in defense contracts - but need to have a relationship with the Kremlin, like, you know, everyone running a business in Russia.<br/><br/>Russia's Billionaires: The Ultimate Silent Bikers<br/><br/>In short, Putin's policies have turned Russia's billionaires into silent backers of his war effort. And they're not even whispering their discontent. It's like they've all been hypnotized by the mighty Vladimir - or maybe it's just the thought of losing everything they own.<br/><br/>Whatever the reason, one thing is certain: Western sanctions haven't worked as planned. Putin's billionaires are still here, and they're more powerful than ever. So go ahead, try to sanction them again - see if we care!<br/><br/>Bonus Fact: Have you heard about Boris Berezovsky, Russia's most powerful oligarch? He claimed to have orchestrated Putin's ascent to presidency in 2000, but ended up dead in mysterious circumstances in exile in the UK. Spooky!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling saga of billionaires and tyrants!</p>
