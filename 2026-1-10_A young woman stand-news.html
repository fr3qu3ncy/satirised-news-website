        <p>Ukraine's population is dwindling faster than a Kardashian marriage due to war, conscription, and a general sense of apocalyptic dread.</p>

        <p>TUMBLING MARRIAGE AND BIRTH RATES: THE UKRAINE POPULATION CRISIS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Ukrainian population has hit an all-time low – and it's not because of the zombie apocalypse that nobody warned us about. Nope, this time it's just good old-fashioned war that's causing the numbers to plummet.<br/><br/>DATING IN WAR-TIME UKRAINE: A REAL CHALLENGE<br/><br/>Meet Daria, a 34-year-old Kyiv resident who's been single for so long she can barely remember what it's like to have a decent date. "I haven't had a proper date since before the war," she says with a straight face. And by "proper date", I mean not just a casual hookup with some guy who's trying to avoid conscription.<br/><br/>CONSCRIPTS, SOLDIERS, AND BOYS WITH BAND-AIDS: THE UKRAINIAN MAN SHORTAGE<br/><br/>It turns out that the men in Ukraine are either fighting on the front lines or desperately trying to avoid being drafted. Which means there aren't many eligible bachelors left for women like Daria to choose from. In fact, Khrystyna, a 28-year-old woman from Lviv, says it's getting pretty tough to meet someone who's not afraid to go out and get their military ID revoked.<br/><br/>THE DEMOGRAPHIC DISASTER<br/><br/>According to Oleksandr Hladun, a demographer at Ukraine's National Academy of Sciences (which sounds like a real party school), the population crisis is a result of the war causing a sharp decline in marriage rates. In 2022, there were 223,000 marriages; by 2024, that number had plummeted to just 150,000. And let's not forget about the birth rate: it's now at an all-time low of 0.9 children per woman.<br/><br/>THE COMING APOLCALYPSE<br/><br/>In five years' time, Ukraine is expected to have a population of only 25.2 million people – less than half what it was in 1992. Yeah, that's just peachy. It's like the country's population is slowly being sucked into some kind of demographically-themed vortex.<br/><br/>AND SO THE FERTILITY CLINIC WAITLIST GETS LONGER...<br/><br/>Meanwhile, couples like Olena and her husband are struggling to have kids in a war-torn country where even the fertility clinics are understaffed. It's like they're stuck in some kind of bizarre time loop where everyone's trying to avoid getting pregnant.<br/><br/>SUMMARY: WE'RE ALL DOOMED<br/><br/>In conclusion, Ukraine's population is dwindling faster than a Kardashian marriage. With fewer men, lower birth rates, and a general sense of apocalyptic dread hanging over the country like a bad omen, it's clear that we're all just one step away from total societal collapse.<br/><br/>SO IF YOU SEE ME RUNNING AROUND WITH A "WORLD'S OKAY" SIGN IN 2051...<br/><br/>Just know that I've given up on humanity and are now preparing for the impending doom of Ukraine's demographic disaster.</p>
