        <p>In a bizarre attempt to combat stalking, South Korea has created an app called "StalkerSpotter" that allows victims to track their creepy ex-boyfriends and coworkers using wearable devices and alert authorities when they get too close.</p>

        <p>STALKER SQUAD: South Korea Introduces App to Track Creepy Coworkers and Ex-Boyfriends<br/><br/>In a bold move to protect its citizens from the scourge of stalking, South Korea has announced the development of an app that will track down those pesky ex-boyfriends and coworkers who just won't take no for an answer.<br/><br/>The app, dubbed "StalkerSpotter," uses wearable electronic devices (think Fitbits with a vengeance) to track the whereabouts of stalkers. And by "stalkers," we mean anyone who's been deemed "creepy" by the victim. Because, let's be real, being "creepy" is basically a crime in South Korea.<br/><br/>According to reports, the app will show victims their stalker's location on a map, complete with a big red X marked "You're Not Welcome Here." This way, victims can easily avoid those pesky stalkers and get back to their lives without fear of being creeped out.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The app will also alert authorities if the stalker is within a certain proximity (think 10 feet, give or take) of the victim. Because who needs personal space when you can have a SWAT team on standby?<br/><br/>Critics are already calling the app a "band-aid solution" to a much larger problem – namely, South Korea's epidemic of violence against women. And by "critics," we mean all the women in South Korea who've been secretly filmed by spy cameras and faced hostile threats for being feminists.<br/><br/>But hey, at least now they'll have an app to track their stalkers with! As one victim noted, "I'm not sure if this is a step forward or just more tech-savvy stalking. Either way, I'm still going to wear my 'I'm Not Creepy' t-shirt every day."<br/><br/>In related news, the South Korean government has announced plans to introduce a new national holiday – "National Stalker-Free Day" – which will be celebrated with parades, fireworks, and a big ol' party to commemorate the fact that no one is allowed to creep anyone out on this particular day.<br/><br/>And if you're wondering what kind of punishment stalkers can expect in South Korea these days... well, let's just say they'll be facing "stalker jail" – a special maximum-security prison where the only thing more plentiful than the inmates are the surveillance cameras and police officers with stun guns.<br/><br/>So there you have it – South Korea's bold new approach to stalking: track, report, and imprison. Because when in doubt, just add more tech and some sternly-worded warnings from the authorities!</p>
