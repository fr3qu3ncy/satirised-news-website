    <div class="article">
        <p>**Pavarotti's Statue: A Frosty Reception**<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left the opera world in stitches, a statue of Luciano Pavarotti has been encased in an ice rink in the Italian town of Pesaro. The late tenor's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani, was not amused.<br/><br/>"I'm furious," she declared. "I mean, who needs a Pavarotti statue when you can have a hockey rink? It's just absurd."<br/><br/>The ice rink, which was constructed in the town square, has the opera legend's life-size bronze statue knee-deep in ice, surrounded by perspex walls and a sign that reads "Give a high-five to Pavarotti." It's unclear who came up with this idea, but it's safe to say they won't be winning any prizes for Original Thinking.<br/><br/>Mayor Andrea Biancani, who was responsible for the decision, apologized profusely. "We didn't mean to offend anyone," he said. "We just wanted to give Pavarotti a little something special. Who knew he loved ice skating?"<br/><br/>But it's not just the ice rink that has caused controversy – the statue itself is also under scrutiny. According to sources close to the matter, the designers who created the statue were instructed to add a few extra features to make it more "interesting." And by interesting, we mean they added some ridiculous-looking skates and a hockey stick.<br/><br/>"It's like they took one look at Pavarotti's face and said, 'You know what would be funny? If he was wearing roller skates!' " exclaimed an anonymous source. "I mean, who does that to the memory of a great man?"<br/><br/>Pavarotti's family is still trying to process this turn of events. "We're shocked, we're appalled, and we're also slightly amused," said Alice Pavarotti, the late tenor's daughter. "But mainly we're just confused. Why would you do that to your dad's statue?"<br/><br/>As for Biancani, he's trying to salvage what's left of his reputation. "We'll make sure to give Pavarotti a proper sendoff this time," he promised. "No more ice rinks or silly skates. We'll just... um... put him in a nice corner and forget about it."<br/><br/>In related news, the Italian Parliament has voted unanimously to make femicide a crime – but we're pretty sure that's not directly related to Pavarotti's statue.<br/><br/>**Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!**<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>**Update:** In response to public outcry, Biancani has announced plans to dismantle the ice rink and restore Pavarotti's statue to its former glory. "We hear you, people!" he exclaimed. "And by 'you,' we mean the people who actually care about Pavarotti's memory."<br/><br/>However, sources close to the matter claim that the ice rink will be replaced with a new attraction: a roller coaster. That's right – because what's more fitting for an opera legend than a thrill ride?<br/><br/>"It's going to be huge!" said Biancani. "Just like Pavarotti's ego!"<br/><br/>We're not sure if this is a joke or not, but we're definitely intrigued.<br/><br/>**Stay tuned, folks! This story is still developing!**</p>
