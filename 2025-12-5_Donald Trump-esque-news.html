        <p>TRUMP HAILS 'HISTORIC' PEACE DEAL BETWEEN DR CONGO AND RWANDA - BUT IT'S REALLY JUST AN EXCUSE TO GET HIS HANDS ON SOME RARE EARTH MINERALS<br/><br/>In a bizarre ceremony at the newly-renamed "Donald J Trump Institute of Peace" (which is actually just a fancy name for a conference room in Washington D.C.), US President Donald Trump hailed a peace deal between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda as "historic". But let's be real, folks - this was all just a ruse to get his hands on some sweet, sweet rare earth minerals.<br/><br/>At the signing ceremony, which featured a cameo appearance by Vanilla Ice (yes, really), Trump said that the US would send "some of our biggest and greatest companies over to the two countries" to extract the valuable minerals. And by "biggest and greatest companies", we mean ExxonMobil and Halliburton - because who needs peace when you can have oil?<br/><br/>The deal was signed by the presidents of DR Congo and Rwanda, Félix Tshisekedi and Paul Kagame respectively, but it's worth noting that they didn't exactly seem thrilled to be there. In fact, their body language was so frosty that it could've been used as a makeshift ice rink.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Trump also announced that he would be hosting a "Peace Deal Cook-Off" competition at the next summit, where leaders from around the world can compete to see who can make the best diplomatic deals over a plate of fried chicken. Because what's more peaceful than a plate of fried chicken?<br/><br/>The ceremony was attended by a number of other African leaders, including those of Kenya, Angola, Burundi, and Togo - all of whom were no doubt thrilled to be there for the free lunch.<br/><br/>But despite Trump's boasts about the "historic" nature of the deal, analysts are skeptical that it will actually lead to lasting peace. In fact, they're more likely to believe that the real goal of the summit was to get Trump's hands on some rare earth minerals - because let's face it, folks, he's always been a bit of a mineral enthusiast.<br/><br/>And in related news, the M23 rebels (who are basically just a bunch of Congolese Robin Hoods) were not present at the ceremony, but they did release a statement saying that they would be continuing their fight against the DR Congo army. Because when you're fighting for peace and justice, it's always better to do it with a rifle than a pen.<br/><br/>SPECS OF THE PEACE DEAL:<br/><br/>* Both parties agree to stop supporting armed groups (but let's be real, Trump is still going to send ExxonMobil in there to extract those rare earth minerals).<br/>* All parties agree to respect national borders and sovereignty (except for when they're not - because who needs rules when you've got a good lawyer?).<br/>* The US agrees to send "some of our biggest and greatest companies" over to the two countries to help with peace-keeping (aka oil exploration).<br/><br/>SPECIAL GUEST APPEARANCE BY:<br/><br/>* Vanilla Ice, who showed up at the ceremony because why not?<br/>* The Spice Girls, who performed a rendition of "Wannabe" in support of world peace (but unfortunately got booed off stage).<br/>* A troupe of Congolese breakdancers, who did some pretty sweet moves to celebrate the deal.<br/><br/>Stay classy, America!</p>
