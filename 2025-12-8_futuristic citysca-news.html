        <p>BREAKING: EU Regulator Fined for Being a Total Bummer<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the European Union's regulator has been fined €120 million by social media platform X (formerly known as Twitter) for being an absolute buzzkill. The fine was issued after the regulator was caught trying to "take advantage" of a rarely-used account to promote its post about the fine on Friday.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter, Nikita Bier, a senior role at X, accused the EU regulator of trying to "exploit" the platform's advertising system. Bier claimed that the regulator had posted a link which itself deceived users - tricking them into thinking it was a video "to artificially increase its reach." He said this had never been abused like this before and that an exploit had now been removed.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, a European Commission spokesperson said, "We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms' own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework... or else!" (Note: we made up the "or else!")<br/><br/>This development comes on the heels of a heated dispute between X and global regulators. In 2024, Brazil's Supreme Court lifted a ban on X after it agreed to pay 28 million reais ($5.1m; £3.8m) for being naughty, and blocked accounts accused of spreading misinformation. The previous year, Australia's internet safety watchdog fined it A$610,000 ($386,000; £317,360) for failing to cooperate with a probe into anti-child abuse practices.<br/><br/>In response to the fine, Elon Musk posted on his platform to say the EU "should be abolished," and retweeted a response from another X user comparing it to fascism. US Secretary of State Marco Rubio and the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) accused the EU regulator of attacking and censoring US firms, adding, "the days of censoring Americans online are over." (It's worth noting that this is probably not true.)<br/><br/>EU Regulator Response: We're Not Censoring You!<br/><br/>In a statement, the European Commission said it was simply using the tools that platforms themselves were making available to its corporate accounts. It claimed that X had opened up its users to scams and impersonations by failing to provide transparency around its adverts, and not giving researchers access to public data.<br/><br/>"We expect these tools to be fully in line with the platforms' own terms and conditions, as well as with our legislative framework," it said, before adding a wink emoji 😉.<br/><br/>What's Next?<br/><br/>The EU regulator has been given 60 days to respond to X about concerns surrounding its blue checkmarks. If they don't comply, they face extra penalties... or else! (You know the drill by now).<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Bonus: Here are some bonus links to other stories related to social media and online shenanigans:<br/><br/>* TikTok Trend Sees Shop Sell Six Miles of Ribbon: A bizarre trend has taken over TikTok, where users are buying absurd amounts of ribbon from a shop.<br/>* Australia Is Banning Social Media for Kids Under 16.
