        <p>EUROPEAN ALLIES GET ANGRY, PULL OUT ROLLER SKATES AND GIVE DENMARK A HIGH-FIVE FOR REJECTING TRUMP'S GREENLAND GRAB<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the European allies of Denmark have finally woken up from their afternoon siestas and rejected Trump's ridiculous ideas to annex Greenland. And by "rejected", we mean they got up from the couch, put on their roller skates, and gave Denmark a high-five for doing the right thing.<br/><br/>"I'm telling you, Bob," said a spokesperson for the European Union, "we've had enough of this guy trying to buy our friends' territories. I mean, come on, Greenland? It's like he wants to be the boss of everyone's backyard."<br/><br/>The US Vice-President JD Vance was overheard saying, "Hey, don't worry about it, guys. We'll just send in the Navy SEALs and take it by force. We've got a team of highly trained dolphins who can do the job for us."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was spotted doing the cha cha slide with her European counterparts, singing "We're not buying what you're selling, Trumpy boy, no way!"<br/><br/>The Greenlanders themselves were overheard saying, "Hey, thanks for sticking up for us, Europe! Now if you'll excuse us, we've got to get back to our regular activities – like complaining about the weather and eating fermented shark."<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, it was revealed that Trump's advisors had been planning to use a team of trained llamas to negotiate with the Greenlanders. But unfortunately for them, the llamas ended up getting lost on the way to the negotiating table and were last seen playing with a ball in a field.<br/><br/>In related news, Trump has offered to buy Denmark a new set of roller skates if they just agree to let him have Greenland. But Denmark's response was, "Uh, no thanks, Donald. We've got our own wheels, thank you very much."</p>
