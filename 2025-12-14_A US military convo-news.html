        <p>BREAKING: US Soldiers, Civilian Interpreter, and a Chicken Named Cluck Norris Killed in Syria<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two US soldiers, a civilian interpreter, and a chicken named Cluck Norris (yes, you read that right) were killed in an ambush by an Islamic State (IS) gunman in Palmyra, Syria. The attack was so brutal, it's rumored that the soldiers' commander, General John "Hannibal" Lee, lost his mustache as he watched the carnage unfold.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Cluck Norris, a 3-year-old chicken from Iowa who was on a mission to bring peace and understanding to the war-torn region, was killed in the crossfire. Witnesses described the scene as "absolute chaos," with soldiers running around like headless chickens (pun intended).<br/><br/>"We were just walking down the street, having a nice cup of tea, when suddenly we heard gunfire," said a local resident. "I turned to my friend and said, 'Oh dear, it seems someone has brought a gun to a knife fight.' Little did I know, that 'someone' was Cluck Norris."<br/><br/>The US military has confirmed the deaths of two soldiers, who were later identified as Chuck Norris's long-lost cousins (no relation to the famous actor). The civilian interpreter, a 25-year-old named Bob, was last seen trying to negotiate with the IS gunman using only interpretive dance.<br/><br/>"We're investigating the incident and will get to the bottom of it," said General Lee, who was reportedly seen weeping uncontrollably after losing his mustache. "In the meantime, please send all condolence messages to Cluck Norris's family in Iowa. They're going to need a lot of chicken soup."<br/><br/>UPDATE: President Donald Trump has released a statement condemning the attack and promising a "very serious retaliation." However, sources close to the White House have revealed that the President was actually talking about his favorite TV show, "The Walking Dead," when he said this.<br/><br/>"It's just not right, folks. The zombies on that show are so much more formidable than any IS gunman," Trump tweeted later.</p>
