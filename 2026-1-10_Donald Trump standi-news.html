        <p>GREENLAND: THE ULTIMATE FISHING SPOT?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has announced that the US plans to "own" Greenland, because, you know, it's just so darn nice there. I mean, who wouldn't want to own a place with an ice cap, fjords, and polar bears?<br/><br/>According to Trump, Russia and China are also interested in buying Greenland, but he's like, "No way, Jose! We'll take it the easy way or the hard way... just kidding, we'll totally take it by force." Because, you know, that's exactly what you do when someone doesn't want to sell you their land – you invade them with a bunch of heavily armed Americans.<br/><br/>Now, I'm no expert, but I think Denmark might have something to say about this. In fact, they've already issued a statement saying, "Uh, no thanks, America! We like being friends and all, but Greenland is not for sale." But Trump's all like, "Oh, come on, guys! It's just a little lease agreement... or maybe we'll just annex it. No biggie!"<br/><br/>In related news, the people of Greenland are freaking out because they don't want to be Americans. Like, who can blame them? They've got their own culture, their own language (Kalaallisut), and their own hot tubs filled with lukewarm water. Who needs that when you can have a Trump tweetstorm?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the US military is all like, "Hey, we've got a base in Greenland already! It's just a little thing we call Pituffik... or 'the place where we store all our leftover pizza boxes'." But seriously, they do have a pretty sweet setup there – complete with a bunch of snowmen and some really good hot chocolate.<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, Denmark is scrambling to reassure its Nato allies that everything will be fine. Like, sure it will... as long as we don't get invaded by America. In fact, they've issued a statement saying, "Hey, guys! We're all friends here. Let's just agree to disagree and have a nice cup of coffee instead." And Trump's all like, "Coffee? Ha! We'll take the hard way... or maybe just make some more coffee."<br/><br/>So there you have it – Greenland: the ultimate fishing spot, unless Russia and China get there first. Or America invades. Or everyone just decides to stay home and watch Netflix together. The possibilities are endless!<br/><br/>UPDATE: The people of Greenland are now protesting in the streets with signs that read, "We don't want to be Americans! We want to be Greenlanders!" And Trump's all like, "Oh, come on guys! Can't we just have a nice lunch and talk about this?"</p>
