        <p>Breaking News: Chaos Ensues in Minneapolis as ICE Agent Mistakenly Shoots Woman Who Refuses to Give Him a Cheesy Grin<br/><br/>MINNEAPOLIS, MN - In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, a US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent opened fire on a woman who was merely trying to avoid giving him a smile. Yes, you read that right - a smile.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Renee Nicole Good, 37, was driving her Honda SUV when she spotted Jonathan Ross, a veteran ICE agent, filming her with his phone while another agent approached her car. Good, who had clearly been in a meeting with her husband and dog (yes, you read that right too), politely declined to give the agent a smile, saying "That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you." Little did she know, this was about to become a fatal mistake.<br/><br/>As the agents tried to convince Good to exit her vehicle, things took a turn for the worse when Becca Good, Renee's wife, appeared on the scene and told the ICE agent, "You want to come at us? You want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy." This exchange was apparently not taken as a joke by Ross, who mistook it for a sign of aggression.<br/><br/>In a split second, Good's car suddenly veered off in an unexpected direction (or so we're told), prompting Ross to shout, "Woah, woah!" and subsequently open fire. The rest, as they say, is history. Good's car crashed into the side of the road, and she was fatally shot by Ross.<br/><br/>The video footage of the incident, which has since gone viral on social media, shows a dog (yes, you guessed it again) in the backseat of Good's SUV, seemingly oblivious to the chaos unfolding before its eyes. The clip also captures Becca Good filming the interaction with her phone, while another agent approaches the driver's side and uses an expletive.<br/><br/>In related news, US Vice-President JD Vance has taken to social media to defend Ross's actions, stating that the ICE agent "properly defended himself from being run over." Meanwhile, Democratic Minneapolis Mayor Jacob Frey has dismissed this account as "garbage," citing the video footage as evidence of Good's innocence.<br/><br/>As protests continue to erupt across the US in response to this incident, we can't help but wonder: what exactly does a smile have to do with anything?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>Side note: In other news, the ice cream shop down the street from the shooting scene has announced a 50% discount on all smiles today.</p>
