        <p>BREAKING: Tatiana Schlossberg, Granddaughter of John F Kennedy, Dies at 35 After Losing Battle with Cancer<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Tatiana Schlossberg, the 35-year-old granddaughter of former US President John F. Kennedy, has passed away after a brave battle with cancer. But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom – she left behind a legacy of being a climate journalist, a bestselling author, and a fierce warrior against... well, you know.<br/><br/>The Story: A Life Cut Short<br/><br/>Tatiana was diagnosed with an aggressive form of cancer last month, which gave her less than a year to live. But this didn't stop her from fighting like a lion – or in this case, like a Kardashian at a family reunion. She wrote an essay about her diagnosis, detailing the pain and struggle she faced, and how it affected her family, including her husband George Moran and their two adorable kids, Edwin (3) and Josephine (1).<br/><br/>The Family: A Who's Who of Politicians<br/><br/>Tatiana's family is like a who's who of politicians – you've got John F. Kennedy, the former US President; Caroline Kennedy, Tatiana's mom and a diplomat extraordinaire; Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Tatiana's uncle and a climate activist (not to be confused with the other RFK Jr., who's an anti-vaxxer); Maria Shriver, Tatiana's aunt and a journalist; Jack Schlossberg, Tatiana's brother and a Congress hopeful... you get the picture.<br/><br/>The Essay: A Must-Read<br/><br/>Tatiana's essay about her diagnosis was published in The New Yorker last month. It's a heart-wrenching read that'll make you laugh, cry, and maybe even think twice about your own mortality. She writes about the pain she faces, the treatments she undergoes, and how it affects her family.<br/><br/>The Legacy: Climate Journalism<br/><br/>Tatiana was a climate journalist extraordinaire, writing for The New York Times and authoring the bestselling book "Inconspicuous Consumption." She was passionate about climate change and wanted to educate others about it. Her legacy will live on through her work – and maybe even inspire you to become a climate journalist too.<br/><br/>The Response: A Flood of Tributes<br/><br/>Tributes are pouring in from all corners of the world for Tatiana Schlossberg. Maria Shriver wrote, "She loved her life," while Prince William (yes, that Prince William) was spotted chatting with Tatiana's family at a JFK library event last year.<br/><br/>The Aftermath: A Celebration of Life<br/><br/>In the wake of Tatiana's passing, her family is celebrating her life and legacy. Her husband George Moran wrote on Instagram, "Tatiana was a warrior – she fought hard against cancer, and we're all going to miss her fierce spirit."</p>
