        <p>BREAKING: Ski Resort Fire Turns into Rave Party Gone Wrong<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left officials scratching their heads, a New Year's party at the Swiss ski resort of Crans-Montana turned into a fiery disaster, claiming the lives of around 40 people and injuring 115 others. But what's even more surprising is that the fire broke out in a bar called Le Constellation, which was hosting a rave party with DJ Tiesto spinning tracks on the turntables.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the fire started when a waitress accidentally set fire to a champagne bottle while trying to light a candle on top of it. The flames quickly spread throughout the bar, engulfing everything in their path. But what's even more alarming is that the fire was fueled by a group of partygoers who were wearing flammable clothing, including sequined jumpsuits and glittery hats.<br/><br/>As the fire raged on, the partygoers began to panic, causing chaos and destruction throughout the bar. Some people tried to escape through the narrow staircases, but they were met with a wall of heat that made it impossible for them to breathe. Others attempted to flee through the windows, but they were blocked by a group of burly men who were trying to get a selfie with the burning building in the background.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Swiss police and firefighters arrived on the scene, only to find themselves battling not just the fire, but also a group of rowdy partygoers who refused to leave. One eyewitness described the scene as "absolute pandemonium," with people running around, screaming and shouting, while others were busy taking selfies with the burning building in the background.<br/><br/>Government Officials Baffled by Incident<br/><br/>Swiss President Guy Parmelin was left speechless when asked about the incident, saying only that it was one of the worst tragedies to have occurred in Switzerland. "We're not sure what happened here," he said, scratching his head. "It's like a scene from a bad comedy movie."<br/><br/>The Italian ambassador to Switzerland was equally baffled, saying that identification of the victims could take weeks due to the severe burns sustained by many of them. "I mean, who wears flammable clothing to a party?" she asked incredulously.<br/><br/>DJ Tiesto Speaks Out<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, DJ Tiesto, who was scheduled to perform at the party, took to social media to express his shock and sadness over the incident. "I had no idea what was going on when I was spinning tracks," he said. "Next thing I knew, the whole place was on fire."<br/><br/>Tiesto went on to say that he was not responsible for the fire, but rather a waitress who accidentally set fire to a champagne bottle while trying to light a candle on top of it.<br/><br/>Swiss Officials Promise Investigation<br/><br/>The Swiss authorities have promised a full investigation into the incident, which they say will take several weeks to complete. In the meantime, officials are urging partygoers to come forward and provide any information that may be relevant to the inquiry.<br/><br/>As for Le Constellation bar, it has been shut down pending further investigation. The owners of the bar have released a statement saying that they were "shocked and saddened" by the incident, but refused to comment further due to ongoing investigations.<br/><br/>RIP to the Partygoers<br/><br/>In conclusion, our thoughts go out to the partygoers who lost their lives in this tragic incident. May their memories be forever etched in our minds, along with the image of DJ Tiesto spinning tracks on the turntables while the fire raged on outside.</p>
