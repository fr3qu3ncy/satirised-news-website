        <p>CALIFORNIA FLOODS: "IT'S RAINING CATS AND DOGS, LITERALLY"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, even modest additional rainfall in California has caused floods and mudslides to become a major concern for forecasters. Yes, you read that right - CATS AND DOGS.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the rain has gotten so heavy that it's started raining cats and dogs, with some witnesses even claiming to have seen Elvis Presley's ghost walking around, singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" while dodging puddles. We repeat: this is not a drill.<br/><br/>The US National Weather Service (NWS) has issued a flood warning, stating that "the potential for flooding will be high" - which, let's be honest, is a bit of an understatement considering the fact that cats and dogs are now being swept away by the raging waters. We're told that the rain is so intense that it's causing people to spontaneously break into song and dance in the middle of streets, much to the delight of onlookers.<br/><br/>"FLOOD WATCHES AND ADVISORIES REMAIN IN EFFECT AS IT WON'T TAKE MUCH ADDITIONAL RAIN TO CREATE FLOODING ISSUES TODAY, ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS WHERE SOME AREAS HAVE RECEIVED CLOSE TO 18 INCHES OF RAIN SINCE TUESDAY... NOT TO MENTION A FEW HUNDRED CATHEDRALS AND AT LEAST ONE WHOLE FOOTBALL TEAM"<br/><br/>The NWS also warned that the rain is expected to continue throughout the day, with some areas receiving up to 9 inches of rainfall - which, we're told, is equivalent to about a gazillion cats and dogs. We repeat: this is not a drill.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, officials have confirmed that at least three people have died in the catastrophic flooding over the Christmas period, including a 64-year-old man from San Diego who was killed by a fallen tree, a 74-year-old woman who was swept away by floodwaters while trying to escape from her vehicle, and a 70-something woman who was knocked off a rock by a large wave and subsequently eaten by sharks (okay, maybe not that last one, but it's definitely possible).<br/><br/>"OUR OVERALL PICTURE IS THAT THERE'S JUST ONE MORE DAY OF THIS MESS, MOSTLY ACROSS SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA, SPECIFICALLY IN THE LA AREA... BUT DON'T WORRY, WE'VE GOT OUR FAVORITE KITTY-CALGARY-POOCH-POLICE TO KEEP US SAFE"<br/><br/>Tom Kines, a senior meteorologist with AccuWeather, told Reuters that the rain is expected to taper off by the evening, but not before causing absolute chaos and destruction throughout the state.<br/><br/>And so, Californians are advised to stay indoors, lock all doors and windows, and most importantly, GET READY FOR THE WORST. Because when it comes to natural disasters, California knows how to do things big - literally.</p>
