        <p>Ukraine Strikes Military Targets (But Also Hits the Hotel Bar)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukraine's military strike program has been revealed to be not just a precision-guided missile system, but also a highly effective way to hit the bar at the hotel where everyone's having a New Year's party.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Russian-installed governor of Kherson, Vladimir Saldo (who looks suspiciously like a Soviet-era cosmonaut), Ukraine conducted a drone strike on a New Year's party in a hotel and cafe in the Russian-occupied southern Kherson region. The attack, which was described as "unleashing hellfire" by one eyewitness, killed at least 27 people and injured over 30.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: the strike was allegedly intended to target a military gathering that was closed to civilians... or so says Ukraine. However, sources close to the Russian government claim that the real target was actually the hotel bar, where everyone was enjoying a free buffet and trying to forget about the whole war thing.<br/><br/>"It's not like we were expecting them to miss," said one Russian official, who wished to remain anonymous but was clearly delighted by the whole ordeal. "I mean, it's not every day you get to say you've been hit by a Ukrainian drone while sipping on a vodka martini."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukraine's defense forces have come out and said that they only conduct strikes against military targets... except when they're at a bar, in which case they just go for the free peanuts.<br/><br/>In related news, the United Nations has issued a statement saying they're looking into the matter and will report back in due time. The European Union's top diplomat has also weighed in, rejecting Russian claims of Ukrainian attacks on government sites... or at least, that's what she said while trying to hide her confusion about the whole thing.<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was spotted standing outside the hotel, looking concerned and holding a giant drone. When asked for comment, he simply shrugged and said, "Can you smell what The Rock is cooking? Because it's not good news for Ukraine."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story... or just go get another drink, because let's be real, who needs to keep up with the news when there are free peanuts involved?</p>
