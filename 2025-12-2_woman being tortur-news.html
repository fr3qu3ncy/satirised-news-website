        <p>**BREAKING: Israeli-Russian Woman Tells BBC She Was Tortured by Iraqi Militants, Invented Confessions to Escape Agony, and Now Wants to Get Her PhD at Princeton**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Elizabeth Tsurkov, an Israeli-Russian woman held captive for two and a half years by militants in Iraq, has come forward with her harrowing tale of torture and survival. Speaking exclusively to the BBC from her hospital bed in Israel (where she's recovering from her ordeal, but still managed to sneak in a Netflix binge-watching session), Ms Tsurkov revealed that she was subjected to extreme abuse for 100 days straight – including being hung by her wrists, electrocuted, and whipped with a stick.<br/><br/>But what makes this story even more jaw-dropping is that Ms Tsurkov claims she invented "confessions" to try to get her captors to stop torturing her. Yep, you read that right. She basically became a human version of Google's auto-complete feature, constantly making up wild conspiracy theories and fake secrets just to keep the torture at bay.<br/><br/>"I learned all sorts of weird stuff," Ms Tsurkov said in an interview with the BBC. "Like, did you know that Israel and the US created ISIS? Or that Saudi Arabia spreads homosexuality through single-sex cafes?" We're not sure if she's joking or not, but we're pretty sure we just got a crash course in 101 Conspiracy Theories.<br/><br/>But it gets even better! Ms Tsurkov claims that her captors were so impressed with her "confessions" that they started to get greedy and demanded more and more outlandish secrets from her. Like, at one point, she was forced to confess to being a secret agent working for the Illuminati (just kidding, but seriously, who wouldn't want to be an Illuminatin' agent?).<br/><br/>Now, you might be wondering how Ms Tsurkov managed to escape this nightmare scenario. Well, it turns out that her torturers were so busy watching cat videos on YouTube (we're not making this up) that they never even checked their Instagram notifications for new followers. Meanwhile, Mark Savaya, a US businessman and former Trump campaigner (yeah, we're still trying to wrap our heads around that too), had just arrived in Baghdad as the US special envoy to Iraq.<br/><br/>According to Ms Tsurkov, Mr. Savaya told Prime Minister Mohammed Shia al-Sudani that President Trump was super annoyed about her captivity and threatened to kill off the entire leadership of Kataib Hezbollah if she wasn't freed within a week (because, you know, one can't just kidnap an Israeli-Russian woman without facing some serious diplomatic consequences).<br/><br/>Long story short, Ms Tsurkov was released after what can only be described as an epic negotiation involving Donald Trump, Mark Savaya, and possibly even the ghost of Saddam Hussein. And now, she's on a mission to complete her PhD at Princeton while also recovering from her physical and mental scars (we're pretty sure we saw a copy of "The Bell Curve" on her nightstand).<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** We've just received word that Ms Tsurkov has been invited to give a keynote speech at the annual "I Survived Torture but Got My PhD Anyway" conference, where she'll be sharing her inspiring story with other survivors and also giving out signed copies of her thesis on comparative politics.</p>
