        <p>BREAKING: Thai Air Force Drops Bombs Near Cambodia's Poipet Border Crossing, Casino Lovers Scramble for Cover<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Thai air force has dropped bombs near the Cambodian town of Poipet, sending casino lovers and gamblers scrambling for cover. Yes, you read that right - casino lovers! Who knew that bombing runs were just a stone's throw away from the slots?<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the bombings came as renewed border clashes show no sign of letting up between the two countries. We're not sure what's more surprising, the fact that Thailand has finally figured out how to use their air force or that Cambodia has somehow managed to build a casino in the middle of nowhere.<br/><br/>The Thai military claimed they targeted a facility storing BM-21 rockets, but sources close to the casino say it was actually just a storage unit for the weekend's poker tournament chips. We're not making this up, folks!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Cambodia's defense ministry said two bombs were dropped near Poipet municipality at around 11:00 am (0400 GMT) Thursday. Sounds like someone had a bad morning commute.<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking - "Why are Thailand and Cambodia fighting again?" Well, let us tell you, it's not just about the border disputes or the landmines hidden in the jungle floor. It's about the bragging rights at the casino bar. I mean, who gets to say they've been bombed twice this month while sipping on a Singapore Sling?<br/><br/>And speaking of bragging rights, Donald Trump is reportedly planning to "make a phone call" to stop the fighting. Because, you know, it's not like he has anything better to do.<br/><br/>As for the people stuck in the crossfire, we're told that thousands are fleeing the area with their poker chips and passports, while others are just trying to get back to their favorite table games without a hangover. Good luck with that!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, or as we like to call it - "Bombing Roulette: The Poipet Edition"!</p>
