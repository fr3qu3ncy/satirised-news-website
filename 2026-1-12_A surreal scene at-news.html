        <p>BREAKING: Trump to Meet Venezuelan Opposition Leader, María Corina Machado, at the White House - But First, Can Someone Please Pass the Donuts?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has announced that he will be meeting with Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado at the White House. Sources close to the President have revealed that the main item on the agenda is not discussing world peace or solving global conflicts, but rather... sharing the Nobel Peace Prize.<br/><br/>That's right, folks! Trump has been coveting the coveted honor since 2022 (or was it 2021? Who's counting?), and now he finally gets to bask in its glory. But wait, there's more! Machado has offered to share the prize with Trump, because who doesn't love a good buddy system?<br/><br/>The President of the United States is expected to attend the meeting wearing his favorite "I'm with stupid" t-shirt (pointing to himself), accompanied by his trusty sidekick, Kanye West. Together, they'll be discussing the finer points of peace and tranquility - or at least, that's what they'll be pretending to do.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Venezuela, Nicolás Maduro has been secretly replaced by a lookalike named "Nicolas the Great." Sources claim that Nicolas has been doing an excellent job as President, mainly because he's been too busy watching cat videos on YouTube to notice anything out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>As Trump and Machado enjoy their donut-filled meeting, the real question remains: Will they be able to solve the global crisis... or will it just turn into another episode of "The Apprentice"?<br/><br/>Side note: The White House has announced that the meeting will be held in a secret location (aka the basement) because "security reasons." Translation: Trump's hair is not looking its best today, and they don't want anyone to see him with a bad hair day.<br/><br/>Update 1: As this article was being written, it was discovered that María Corina Machado has been replaced by her lookalike, "Maria the Great," who has a PhD in Donutology. Sources claim that Maria's thesis on the art of donut-making is going to be published in the next issue of "The Journal of Peace and Donuts."<br/><br/>Update 2: Just as we thought this story couldn't get any crazier... Donald Trump announced that he will be performing a rap battle with Nicolas Maduro (the real one) during their meeting. The topic? Who's the better president, of course! Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.<br/><br/>Update 3: Breaking news: We've just received word from the White House that the Nobel Peace Prize has been replaced by a participation trophy because "everyone gets a prize these days."</p>
