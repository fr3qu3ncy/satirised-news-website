        <p>BREAKING: Billionaire Playboy Babis Becomes Prime Minister, Promises to Cut Ties to Business Empire (But Let's Be Real, He's Still Going to Profit)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, billionaire playboy Andrej Babis has been appointed as the new Prime Minister of the Czech Republic, with his full cabinet expected to take office within days. And by "shocking," I mean not at all surprising, since he's basically been running the country from behind the scenes through his vast business empire Agrofert.<br/><br/>According to sources close to Babis (i.e., his publicist), the Prime Minister-elect has promised to relinquish control over Agrofert and place it in a trust managed by an independent administrator. But let's be real, folks, this is just a fancy way of saying he'll still be calling the shots from behind the scenes.<br/><br/>I mean, come on, Agrofert is like a big ol' octopus with its tentacles wrapped around every aspect of Czech society. You've got your frankfurters, your fertilizers, and even a private health clinic in Prague's eastern suburbs (because who doesn't need a little bit of Babis-backed healthcare?). And let's not forget about the reproductive clinics, the florist chain Flamengo, and the underwear retailer Astratex – it's like he's trying to corner the market on Czech men's fragile egos.<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait, isn't this all a big scandal?" And to that, I say... yeah, kinda. Transparency International has already come out and said that Babis' plan is basically a joke, and that he'll still be able to influence the company's fortunes despite his promises of separation.<br/><br/>But hey, who needs ethics when you've got power and wealth on your side? And besides, as Prime Minister, Babis will have all sorts of new opportunities to line his pockets (I mean, for the good of the country, of course).<br/><br/>So here's to you, Mr. Prime Minister: may your tenure be long and prosperous, and may your trust fund be ever-growing.<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* "Billionaire Playboy Babis' Party Wins Czech Parliamentary Election" – because, why not?<br/>* "Czech Republic Declares Emergency Situation Over Belarus Balloons" – okay, this one's actually kind of serious<br/>* "French Feminists Outraged by Brigitte Macron's Comment About Activists" – because who doesn't love a good French feminist scandal?<br/><br/>Stay classy, Czech Republic.</p>
