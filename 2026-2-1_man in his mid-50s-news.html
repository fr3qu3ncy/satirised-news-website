        <p>BREAKING: Miroslav Lajčák Stepping Down, Because Who Needs Girls and Diplomacy When You Have a Good Lawyer?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Slovakia's national security adviser, Miroslav Lajčák, has resigned after it was revealed that he exchanged messages about girls and diplomacy with the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. Because, you know, associating with a convicted pedophile is just peachy.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (aka our highly trained team of expert gossipmongers), Lajčák's resignation was not due to any wrongdoing on his part, but rather because he wanted to avoid the impending doom that comes with being associated with Epstein. You know, for his reputation and all that jazz.<br/><br/>In a statement released earlier today (which we've totally fabricated for comedic purposes), Lajčák said: "I'm stepping down because I don't want to be responsible for the impending apocalypse that will surely follow my association with Jeffrey Epstein. I mean, have you seen his Netflix series? The man was a total creep."<br/><br/>The news comes as three million files relating to Epstein were released by the US Department of Justice, which we're pretty sure is just a bunch of documents detailing all the crazy stuff he got up to (aka partying with celebrities and making questionable decisions).<br/><br/>While Lajčák denied discussing women with Epstein in an initial statement (which we've also totally fabricated for comedic purposes), it's now been revealed that they had a very intimate conversation about girls, diplomacy, and his favorite color (which was apparently pink).<br/><br/>In the exchange (which we're pretty sure is just a bunch of nonsense we made up), Lajčák and Epstein discussed everything from women to t-shirts featuring Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. Because, you know, that's exactly what you'd want on your t-shirt – a picture of a guy who died in 2016.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Robert Fico, Slovakia's prime minister, announced he had accepted Lajčák's resignation, citing "hypocrisy" and "attack[ing] against me." We're pretty sure this is just code for "I'm trying to deflect attention from my own questionable decisions."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist (which we've totally fabricated for comedic purposes), it's been revealed that Elon Musk, Lord Peter Mandelson, Bill Gates, and Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor were all in on Epstein's little soirees. Because, you know, they're all just a bunch of cool guys who love to party.<br/><br/>And finally, we'd like to take this opportunity to remind everyone that associating with Jeffrey Epstein is not okay. In fact, it's downright terrible. But hey, at least the girls in your life will be impressed by your questionable taste in friends.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word (which we totally fabricated) that Lajčák has been spotted walking out of a Dunkin' Donuts, sipping on a iced coffee and muttering to himself: "I should have just stayed in the diplomatic world...".</p>
