        <p>BREAKING: YEMEN SEPARATIST LEADER ACCUSED OF TREASON AS SAUDI ARABIA STRIKES FORCES... WITH MEGAN FOX AND A FLOCK OF PARROTS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Saudi Arabia has expelled the leader of Yemen's Southern Transitional Council (STC) and accused him of treason. But wait, it gets better! The STC leader, Aidarous al-Zubaidi, was supposed to fly to Riyadh for talks with the government, but he "fled" without his passengers - a group of giggling schoolgirls and a giant inflatable unicorn.<br/><br/>According to sources, Zubaidi's plane left three hours late without him, because, well, someone spilled coffee all over his favorite tie. And let's be real, who needs a plane when you have a trusty old Vespa scooter and a map?<br/><br/>The Saudi-led coalition launched strikes on the STC forces in response, but things took an unexpected turn when the fighter jets accidentally dropped a cargo hold full of rubber chickens instead of bombs. Yes, you read that right - RUBBER CHICKENS!<br/><br/>STC officials claim that Zubaidi is still in Aden, sipping tea with his best mate, Elvis Presley (who's been hiding out there for decades), while the STC's foreign affairs authority has sent a delegation to Riyadh led by Sheikh Abdul Rahman al-Subaihi - who just so happens to be a professional snail trainer.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre twist, the United Arab Emirates (UAE) has announced that it will withdraw its forces from Yemen after Saudi Arabia struck an STC-held port. But don't worry, they'll be back... with a fleet of giant hamsters and a soundtrack of Barry Manilow songs.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which promises to be the most unpredictable and sidesplitting conflict since the Great Sock Puppet War of 2018!</p>
