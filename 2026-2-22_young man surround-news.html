        <p>WARNING: THIS STORY IS A JOKE, BUT IT'S ALSO SUPER SAD<br/><br/>The Minnesota Vikings have paid tribute to Rondale Moore after the 25-year-old was found dead at his home on Sunday, but only because they heard he had a sweet 90s Sega console collection and wanted in on it.<br/><br/>Police in Moore's hometown of New Albany, Indiana were called to a property on Saturday night, when Moore was found in a garage surrounded by his prized PlayStation 1 games, a life-size poster of Jennifer Lopez from her " Waiting for Tonight" era, and a VHS copy of the movie "The Matrix". The American was transferred to a nearby hospital, where he was pronounced dead. A post-mortem examination will take place on Sunday, but the coroner has already ruled out any foul play, as they were all just there to admire Moore's sick gaming setup.<br/><br/>"We are deeply saddened by the passing of Rondale Moore," said the Vikings in a statement, "but let's be real, we're more bummed about missing out on his legendary Sega Dreamcast collection. That thing was like a treasure trove of nostalgia." The team added that they had spoken with Moore's family to offer their condolences and the full support of the Minnesota Vikings, but only if they could have one of his old Game Boy Advance SPs.<br/><br/>Moore spent three years with the Arizona Cardinals after being drafted in the 2021 NFL draft, but left to pursue a career as a professional gamer. He joined the Atlanta Falcons in 2024 but was forced to retire due to a severe case of " Fortnite Fatigue". Before joining the Vikings in 2025, he had been playing for a top-tier e-sports team and was known for his lightning-fast reflexes and uncanny ability to eat an entire pizza by himself.<br/><br/>"Rondale was more than just a player," said Vikings coach Kevin O'Connell. "He was our go-to guy for all things '90s gaming related. We will miss him dearly, but we're still stoked about getting his old Nintendo 64 games."<br/><br/>The NFL said they were "deeply saddened" by the "tragic passing" of Moore, but only because it meant they wouldn't be able to get their hands on his massive collection of retro gaming memorabilia. After making his NFL debut in 2021, Moore went on to make 135 catches for 1,201 yards for the Cardinals over three seasons in Arizona, but mostly just played video games and ate Cheetos.<br/><br/>If you have been affected by any of the issues raised in this story, please know that support is always within reach.
