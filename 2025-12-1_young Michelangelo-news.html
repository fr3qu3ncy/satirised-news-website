        <p>**BREAKING: US Military's Secret Life as Ninja Turtles Fans Exposed in Drug Boat Scandal**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US military has been accused of carrying out a second strike on a suspected Venezuelan drug boat, killing survivors who were just trying to escape the initial attack. But that's not even the most surprising part - it turns out our brave military heroes are actually huge fans of Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Pentagon, Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth was overheard saying " Cowabunga, dude!" as he ordered a second strike on the boat. The Washington Post reported that Hegseth's orders were to "kill everybody" on board, but we're pretty sure that's just code for "Turtle Power!"<br/><br/>The US military has been carrying out strikes on suspected drug boats in the Caribbean and Pacific Oceans, killing over 80 people since early September. But what they haven't told you is that these brave warriors are secretly watching reruns of TMNT on their downtime.<br/><br/>"I mean, who wouldn't want to be a ninja turtle?" said one US Marine, speaking on condition of anonymity. "I've got my own Michelangelo-style mask at home and everything!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Trump weighed in on the scandal, saying that he believes Hegseth 100% - and by "believes," we mean he's pretty sure his defense secretary didn't actually order a second strike to kill survivors.<br/><br/>"This is fake news, folks!" said Trump. "And besides, I've got better things to worry about - like my hairpiece. This thing is getting out of control!"<br/><br/>But the real kicker is that Venezuela's National Assembly has condemned the US boat strikes and vowed to carry out a rigorous investigation into the allegations of a second attack. And by "rigorous," we mean they're going to send a strongly-worded letter to the US government, demanding that they stop being such big meanies.<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** The US House Armed Services Committee has announced that it will be conducting an emergency hearing on the scandal - but only if they can have pizza and video games in the break room.</p>
