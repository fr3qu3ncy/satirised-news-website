        <h2>KILAUEA VOLCANO GOES ROGUE, TAKES OUT CAMERA CREW AND THEIR INTELLECT</h2>

        <p>Hawaii's Kilauea volcano has gone rogue and started spewing lava everywhere, engulfing a camera crew's equipment and causing chaos that was likened to something out of a bad sci-fi movie.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Kilauea Volcano Gets a Little Too Rowdy for Its Own Good<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Hawaii's most active volcano has gone rogue and started spewing lava everywhere - including at a camera crew trying to get some sweet Instagram shots. The footage from the US Geological Survey (USGS) shows the camera glitching and stalling before its feed drops out in the wake of the eruption. We're pretty sure that's not what they meant by "volcanic ash" in their press release.<br/><br/>The camera, which was positioned to capture the majesty of Kilauea's eruptions, got caught up in a sudden surge of molten lava, flames, and general chaos. Witnesses describe it as "like something out of a bad sci-fi movie." The crew was seen running for cover while shouting, "It's coming! It's coming!" - only to trip on their own feet and face-plant into the nearby parking lot.<br/><br/>"We were just trying to get some shots for our volcano-themed TikTok series," said an embarrassed USGS spokesperson. "But, you know, it got out of hand. Next thing we knew, our camera was engulfed in flames and everyone was running around like headless chickens."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, nearby residents are taking the whole ordeal in stride. "It's just another Tuesday for us here in Hawaii," said one resident, shrugging. "We've seen worse - like that time the pineapple plantation caught fire and we had to evacuate our entire town."<br/><br/>The lava flow has been intermittent since December last year (just like everyone's New Year's resolutions), but this latest eruption has left many scratching their heads. "What's going on with Kilauea?" asked a concerned volcano expert. "It's like it's having some kind of midlife crisis or something!"<br/><br/>To make matters worse, President Trump took to Twitter to weigh in on the situation: "Just got word that the lava flow at Kilauea is huge - believe me, folks, no one knows more about big lava flows than I do. Sad! #MakeVolcanoesGreatAgain"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which we're sure will be a real blast (see what we did there?).</p>
