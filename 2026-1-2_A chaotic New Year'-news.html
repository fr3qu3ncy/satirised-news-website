        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Bar Fire Spreads Like Crazy, 40 Dead, and Now Everyone's Blaming Each Other<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a fire broke out at a Swiss bar on New Year's Eve, killing at least 40 people and injuring many more. Because what's more fun than celebrating the start of a new year by running for your life while being chased by flames?<br/><br/>Investigations Reveal Sparklers Were the Culprit (Not the Hangover)<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, sparklers attached to champagne bottles held too close to the ceiling caused the fire. We repeat: SPARKLERS. Because what's a New Year's Eve party without someone trying to relive their childhood with some DIY fireworks?<br/><br/>Bottles, Foam, and Panic<br/><br/>Two images have surfaced online showing people holding sparklers attached to champagne bottles, walking through the bar with foam-like padding on the ceiling (which we're pretty sure is a great way to create a dance floor... or not). It seems like the partygoers were just trying to get into the holiday spirit by creating their own mini-fireworks display. Who knew it would end in tragedy?<br/><br/>Professor Edwin Galea Weighs In: "Flashover" and "Fatal Bottlenecks"<br/><br/>Fire safety expert Professor Edwin Galea explained that a "flashover" occurred, which is like when you're trying to get out of bed on a Sunday morning and your partner has just farted. It's instantaneously hot, chaotic, and everyone panics. Meanwhile, staircase exits become "fatal bottlenecks," because let's face it, people are clumsy and will trip over anything.<br/><br/>The Real Question: Who's Going to Pay for the Champagne?<br/><br/>As officials scramble to determine what went wrong, one thing is clear: someone's going to get sued. And we're not talking about the bar owners; we mean the person who brought the sparklers. It's a wonder they didn't also bring some silly string and party hats.<br/><br/>In Other News...<br/><br/>* Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has been spotted at the scene, giving emotional support to the survivors.<br/>* The Swiss government has announced plans to install fire extinguishers that shoot confetti instead of water. It's a bold move, but hey, who doesn't love a good party?<br/>* And in a related story, the makers of sparklers have seen an unprecedented surge in sales.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
