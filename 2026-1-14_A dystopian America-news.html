        <p>TRUMP TAKES IT UP A NOTCH: IMMIGRANT VISA PROCESSING Halted for 75 Countries Because, Apparently, They Love Free Stuff<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the world wondering what other absurd thing Donald Trump will come up with next, the US State Department announced today that it's putting the kibosh on immigrant visa processing from 75 countries. Yes, you read that right – 75! That's like saying, "Hey, we've got a great new policy: if your name starts with an 'M' or a 'Z', sorry, buddy!"<br/><br/>According to sources (okay, it was just some dude who works in the State Department), the reason for this drastic measure is that these countries are just too darn generous. I mean, who wouldn't want to live in the United States and receive free stuff? It's like they're trying to be American or something!<br/><br/>But seriously, folks, the Trump administration claims it wants to "bring an end to the abuse" of the system by people who would exploit the generosity of the American people. You know, those pesky immigrants who think they can just waltz into the country and start getting free food stamps, housing, and a brand new iPhone from Apple.<br/><br/>Now, we all know that Trump loves his Twitter, so I'm sure he'll be tweeting about this in 3...2...1... "Just made it super clear: NO MORE FREE LUNCHES FOR FOREIGNERS!" #MakeAmericaGreatAgain<br/><br/>The list of affected countries? Well, that's a state secret (get it?). But rumor has it that some of the culprits include:<br/><br/>* Brazil – those guys love their Carnival parties and free caipirinhas.<br/>* Iran – who needs nuclear power when you can just live off government assistance?<br/>* Russia – Putin wants to make America great again, but first, he needs to get some free stuff.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the usual suspects:<br/><br/>* Somalia – because they're already doing a great job of making their own food (pizza delivery is overrated, right?)<br/>* Afghanistan – who needs electricity when you can just camp out in the desert and enjoy the stars?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more!<br/><br/>The Trump administration has also announced that it will be expanding its "travel ban" to include anyone who's ever worn a pair of flip-flops on a Tuesday. That's right; if you've ever been caught slacking off by wearing those pesky sandals, forget about getting into the country – you're not welcome here!<br/><br/>And just in case you were wondering how this is going to affect your travel plans, don't worry! The suspension will only apply to immigrant visas – non-immigrant tourist or business visas are still totally cool. Just make sure to wear a suit and tie when you arrive at the airport; we wouldn't want any... "undesirable" elements sneaking in.<br/><br/>In related news:<br/><br/>* Greenland is talking to Trump about buying them, but it's not going well.<br/>* The US and UK are pulling some personnel from Qatar because of Trump's temper tantrum over Iran.<br/>* And finally, a paraglider survived a 500ft drop into the ocean – I guess that's what you get when you're trying to flee from Trump's immigration policies.<br/><br/>So there you have it – another day in the bizarre world of Donald Trump. Stay tuned for more updates on this and other ridiculous stories!</p>
