        <p>Pavarotti's Widow Not Amused by 'Absurd Decision' to Turn Statue into Ice Rink<br/><br/>In a shocking display of poor taste, the town of Pesaro in Italy has made an "absurd decision" to turn a statue of opera legend Luciano Pavarotti into an ice rink. The widow of the late singer, Nicoletta Mantovani, is reportedly "furious" and "upset" by the decision, which she claims is an attempt to "ridicule" her husband.<br/><br/>The statue, which was unveiled in April this year, has been encased in a giant ice rink, complete with perspex walls and a frozen knee-deep in ice. It's like someone took a page out of the script of 'The Day After Tomorrow' and said, "You know what would be funny? If we put Pavarotti on ice!"<br/><br/>Pavarotti's statue, which is life-size and made of bronze, was originally intended to be a respectful tribute to the legendary singer. However, it seems that the town council had other ideas. They decided to add a touch of absurdity to the statue by surrounding it with an ice rink, complete with a sign that reads "Give a high-five to Pavarotti" in Italian.<br/><br/>When asked about the decision, Mayor Andrea Biancani said, "I didn't mean to offend anyone, but I guess we got carried away with the festive spirit." It's like he thought, "You know what would be a great idea? If we turned Pavarotti into an ice hockey player!"<br/><br/>Ms. Mantovani was not amused by the decision and has accused the council of making a "poorly executed, absurd decision". She said, "I'm angry and upset that they would do this to my husband's memory. It's like they're trying to turn him into some kind of ice sculpture."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, residents of Pesaro are scratching their heads and wondering what possessed the town council to make such a bizarre decision. One resident, who wished to remain anonymous, said, "I mean, I love Pavarotti as much as the next person, but turning his statue into an ice rink? It's just not right."<br/><br/>It seems that the town of Pesaro has learned one valuable lesson: never turn opera legend into an ice sculpture.<br/><br/>In other news, it's been reported that Elton John is planning to release a new album, titled 'Rocket Man on Ice'. When asked about the inspiration behind the album, he said, "I was listening to my old friend Pavarotti's statue on ice and I thought, 'That's a great idea for an album!'".<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It has been reported that Elton John's record label has denied any involvement in the production of 'Rocket Man on Ice'.<br/><br/>In related news, it's been announced that the town of Pesaro will be hosting a series of ice hockey games featuring Pavarotti's statue as the main attraction. The event is expected to draw large crowds and raise money for charity.<br/><br/>When asked about the decision to turn Pavarotti into an ice sculpture, Mayor Biancani said, "We're hoping to attract tourists from all over Italy with this unique event. And who knows? Maybe we'll even get a few high-fives out of it!"<br/><br/>The event is expected to take place on December 25th and will feature a special appearance by Pavarotti's widow, Nicoletta Mantovani.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: It has been reported that Ms. Mantovani has backed out of the event due to "creative differences" with the organizers.<br/><br/>In other news, it's been announced that a team of researchers from Harvard University will be conducting an in-depth study on the psychological effects of turning opera legends into ice sculptures. The study is expected to take several years to complete and will involve extensive interviews with residents of Pesaro.<br/><br/>When asked about the study, one researcher said, "We're hoping to learn more about the human psyche and how it responds to absurd decisions made by town councils."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.</p>
