        <p>BREAKING: Tokyo's 'Calm and Resolute' Response to Beijing's Belligerence is Just Code for 'We're Gonna Have a Tantrum and Then Go Home and Eat Some Ramen'<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Tokyo has vowed to respond with "calm and resoluteness" as tensions with Beijing continue to escalate. Because, you know, nothing says "calm and resolute" like a nation's leaders screaming at each other on the world stage.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Japanese government (okay, it was just a guy on Twitter), Tokyo has been protesting after Chinese fighter jets locked radars onto Japanese aircraft. Yeah, because that's exactly what you want your enemies to do: lock onto your planes and think about maybe shooting them down. It's like when your ex shows up at your doorstep uninvited, but with better hair.<br/><br/>The Chinese navy, meanwhile, has accused Tokyo of "harassing" its forces during a training exercise. Which is just code for "We were having a lovely time bombing each other, and then the Japanese showed up and ruined everything."<br/><br/>In related news, Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi has announced plans to deploy missiles from the island of Yonaguni, which is just what everyone needs: more missiles. Because, you know, we haven't enough already. It's like when your aunt says she's going to bring her famous Jell-O mold to the family reunion, and you're all thinking, "Oh boy, can't wait."<br/><br/>And because this situation isn't absurd enough already, China has banned the importation of seafood from Japan. Which is just a nice way of saying, "Hey, we don't want your stinky fish in our country." It's like when you get a strongly-worded letter from your neighbor asking you to stop playing your accordion at 3 AM.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Tokyo and Beijing are like two teenagers fighting over the last piece of pizza in the fridge. They're both screaming at each other, throwing tantrums, and making a big mess, but ultimately, they'll just end up eating the pizza by themselves because they can't agree on toppings.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The United Nations has issued a statement saying that they're "monitoring the situation" and "asking everyone to please not start World War III just yet." Which is just what you want to hear: a bunch of bureaucrats telling you to calm down while they go get more coffee.</p>
