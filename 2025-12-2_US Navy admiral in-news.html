        <p>**COMEDY VERSION**<br/><br/>**WHITE HOUSE SAYS US NAVY ADMIRAL ORDERED SECOND DEADLY VENEZUELA BOAT STRIKE, BUT WE'RE NOT REALLY SURE WHAT'S GOING ON HERE**<br/><br/>Yesterday, the White House confirmed that a top US Navy admiral ordered a second round of strikes on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. Because what's a good day without a little bit of drone warfare and possible war crimes, right? The "double tap" strike on 2 September has drawn bipartisan scrutiny among US lawmakers, mainly because it's like the plot of a bad action movie – "I'll take out the bad guys, and then I'll just... wait for them to get up again."<br/><br/>The White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth authorised the strikes but didn't give an order to "kill everybody", which is good because that would be a real PR nightmare. Instead, Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law... or so we're told.<br/><br/>More than 80 people have been killed in a number of similar strikes in the Caribbean Sea since early September, mostly by being on boats with illicit drugs. Each announcement from US officials is usually accompanied by grainy video and a note that says "Sorry, no one knows what's going on here." The Trump administration says it's acting in self-defence by destroying boats carrying illicit drugs to the US, mainly because they're like, totally against it or whatever.<br/><br/>Both Republican and Democratic lawmakers have expressed concern over the report of the 2 September incident and vowed congressional reviews of the strikes. You know, just your usual Monday morning – a couple dozen people killed in the name of self-defence, and everyone's just kinda... shrugging.<br/><br/>**EXPERTS RAISE DOUBTS**<br/><br/>Multiple experts who spoke to the BBC have raised serious doubts that the second strike on alleged survivors could be considered legal under international law. In fact, they're pretty sure it's not, but what do we know? The Trump administration has said its operations in the Caribbean is a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers, mainly because "reasons". And if you think about it, that's kinda like saying "I meant to kill those two guys on purpose".<br/><br/>**VEnezuela SEES THIS AS ANOTHER REASON TO NOT LIKE US**<br/><br/>In related news, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a "rigorous and thorough investigation" into the 2 September strikes. Mainly because it's like, totally his job now.<br/><br/>**SENATE ARMED SERVICES COMMITTEE SAYS IT'S GONNA GET TO THE BOTTOM OF THIS WHOLE THING... OR SO THEY SAY**<br/><br/>The Senate Armed Services Committee said on Monday that the lawmakers are planning to interview the admiral who ordered the strikes. You know, because that's what they do – interview people and stuff.<br/><br/>**WHITE HOUSE PRESS SECRETARY KAREN LEAVITT'S TWEET-LENGTH RESPONSE TO THE WHOLE THING WAS**<br/><br/>"Admiral Bradley worked well within his authority and the law... or so we're told."</p>
