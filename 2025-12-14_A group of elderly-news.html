        <p>JOHN CENA TAKES HIS FINAL BOW, AFTER LAST EVER WWE FIGHT... AND GETS CAUGHT IN A HONEY TRAP WITH A GROUP OF ELDERLY NUNS<br/><br/>US actor and wrestler John Cena fought the final fight of his 16 match retirement tournament in Washington on Saturday night, bringing to a close an illustrious 24-year career that saw him become one of wrestling's biggest and most recognisable stars. But little did he know, this was not just any ordinary fight.<br/><br/>As he stepped into the ring for what would be his last WWE match, Cena was unaware that a group of elderly nuns from a local convent had sneaked into the arena, armed with nothing but their sharp wit and an endless supply of baked goods. These were no ordinary nuns, they were known as "The Baking Sisters" and they had been tracking Cena for months, determined to get their hands on his prized WWE championship belt.<br/><br/>As Cena delivered a devastating Attitude Adjustment to his opponent, the crowd erupted into cheers, but the real action was happening backstage where The Baking Sisters had set up their own secret wrestling match. Armed with nothing but their canes and a fierce determination, they took down Cena's entourage one by one, until finally, they faced off against Cena himself.<br/><br/>"I never saw it coming," said Cena in an interview later that night. "I was just trying to get through the match without getting too many bruises, when suddenly I'm face to face with four feisty nuns who are determined to take me down."<br/><br/>The battle was fierce, with Cena using all his wrestling skills to try and fend off The Baking Sisters, but they were relentless. In the end, it was Sister Mary, a fierce and formidable opponent, who delivered the final blow, pinning Cena to the mat and securing the win for her team.<br/><br/>As Cena lay defeated in the ring, The Baking Sisters celebrated their victory, and then promptly offered him a plate of freshly baked cookies and a nice cup of tea. "It's only fair," said Sister Mary, with a wink. "After all, you've been taking down our men for years, it's time we took you down."<br/><br/>WRESTLING COMMUNITY IN SHOCK AS JOHN CENA RETIRES... BUT THE REAL SURPRISE IS WHO REPLACES HIM<br/><br/>In related news, the WWE has announced that John Cena will be replaced as the face of their company by none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's long-lost uncle, Bubba "The Bull" Jackson. Yes, you read that right, Bubba The Bull is the new star of the WWE and he's already causing a stir with his outrageous antics and impressive mustache.<br/><br/>When asked about his new role, Bubba simply shrugged and said, "I'm just happy to be here, folks. I mean, who wouldn't want to wear spandex and hit people for a living? It's like the ultimate dream job."<br/><br/>And so, it seems that John Cena may have thought he was retiring from the WWE, but little did he know that he would soon be facing an even greater challenge: Bubba The Bull.</p>
