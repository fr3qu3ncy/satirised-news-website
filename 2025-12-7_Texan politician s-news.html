        <p>BREAKING: Texan Representative Henry Cuellar's Pardon Turns into a Real-Life Game of "The Price is Right"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Texas Representative Henry Cuellar has decided to run for re-election as a Democrat after being pardoned by Donald Trump. But here's the thing - Trump wasn't exactly thrilled about it. In fact, he was so disappointed that he took to social media to air his grievances, saying "Such a lack of LOYALTY" and calling Cuellar a "Radical Left Scum".<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! As Cuellar filed for re-election as a Democrat, a group of Elton John impersonators burst into the room, singing "Can You Feel the Love Tonight?" while waving tiny American flags. It was just your run-of-the-mill Tuesday afternoon in Texas politics.<br/><br/>Cuellar, however, remained calm and collected, telling Fox News that he's still a conservative Democrat at heart (or should we say, "at brain"?). When asked to respond to Trump's social media post, Cuellar simply shrugged and said, "I'm an American, I'm a Texan, and I'm a Democrat - in that order. And by 'that order', I mean the order of my favorite foods: chicken fried steak, BBQ ribs, and a nice plate of nachos."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump's attack on Cuellar has sparked a heated debate among fans of "The Walking Dead" about whether Daryl Dixon would have pardoned him or not. Some say it's a no-brainer - Daryl would've just shot Cuellar in the head and said, "That's it, buddy, you're outta here!" Others argue that Daryl would've taken one look at Cuellar and said, "Meh, he's alright, I guess," before going off to find some more Negan- approved hair gel.<br/><br/>And if you thought things couldn't get any weirder, just remember - a group of Pokémon characters (Pikachu, Charizard, Squirtle, and Bulbasaur) have been seen strolling around the Texas Capitol building, chanting "Cuellar, Cuellar, he's our man... but not really" while holding tiny copies of the US Constitution.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems like Henry Cuellar's pardon has turned into a real-life game show - except instead of prizes, everyone's competing for the title of "Most Likely to Be Forgotten in the Next 5 Years". Stay tuned, folks!</p>
