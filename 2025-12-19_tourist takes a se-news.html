        <p>TOURISTS WARNED: €2 FEE TO SEE TREVI FOUNTAIN, BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S ONLY TWO EUROS... AND YOU CAN STILL SEE IT FROM A DISTANCE<br/><br/>Rome's Mayor Roberto ‌Gualtieri has announced that tourists will soon have to pay a whopping €2 fee to see the Trevi Fountain up close. But don't panic, folks! You can still get your Instagram-worthy selfie in front of this stunning Baroque monument... from afar. That's right, for just two euros, you can pretend to be interested in the fountain while actually just admiring the surrounding gelato shops.<br/><br/>The new fee, which will come into effect on February 1st, is part of a larger plan to regulate tourist crowds and make sure everyone has a good time (or at least, a good selfie). And let's be real, who needs to see the Trevi Fountain up close when you can just take a photo from across the square with a bunch of other tourists? It's all about the 'gram, am I right?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Rome is also introducing a new queuing system to prevent large crowds from forming. Because, let's face it, who doesn't love waiting in line for 30 minutes just to see some old water feature? It's like Disneyland, but without the mouse ears and overpriced snacks.<br/><br/>And don't worry about those poor tourists who can't afford the €2 fee (because, let's be real, it's a small price to pay for this once-in-a-lifetime experience). They'll still be able to see the Trevi Fountain from afar... or they could just take a quick selfie with some cardboard cutouts of themselves in front of the fountain. Problem solved!<br/><br/>In related news, Rome has also announced plans to turn the Trevi Fountain into a giant trampoline park, because why not? It's not like tourists need to see actual historical landmarks or anything.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Pope Francis has declared the Trevi Fountain a "National Treasure... of Sorts" and has appointed a new Minister of Tourist Craziness to oversee the entire operation. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
