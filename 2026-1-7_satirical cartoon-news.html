    <div class="summery">
        <p>Karnataka's new hate speech bill is a comically inept attempt to eradicate free speech by essentially allowing the government to censor anyone who says something mean about someone else on social media, Twitter, or in public view.</p>

        <p>KARNATAKA'S NEW HATE SPEECH BILL: A LAUGHABLE EFFORT TO ERADICATE FREE SPEECH<br/><br/>In a bizarre attempt to prevent hate speech and hate crimes, the government of Karnataka has passed a bill that critics claim will erode civil liberties. Because what's more effective than passing a law to stop people from saying mean things about each other?<br/><br/>The Karnataka Hate Speech and Hate Crimes (Prevention) Bill, 2025, is like a recipe for disaster. It defines hate speech as any "expression which is made, published, or circulated… in public view" verbally, in print, television or social media. Because who needs freedom of expression when you can just get the government to censor everything?<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The bill gives the state government the power to order social media and digital platforms to take down content it deems hate speech. Which means that if you say something mean about a politician on Twitter, they'll just block you and claim it's for your own good.<br/><br/>The BJP has already protested against the bill, saying it's an attack on free speech. But don't worry, folks! The Congress party is here to save the day with their brand of democracy... err, we mean, dictatorship.<br/><br/>HATE SPEECH EXPLAINED<br/><br/>According to experts, hate speech is like a bad joke that someone tells in a crowded room. You know, the kind where you laugh and then realize, "Oh wait, that was actually really hurtful."<br/><br/>But seriously, hate speech is a complex issue that requires nuanced discussion. Which is why we've come up with a simple solution: just ban all forms of expression that might offend someone. Problem solved!<br/><br/>WHO GETS TO DECIDE WHAT'S HATE SPEECH?<br/><br/>The bill gives the state government the power to decide what's hate speech and what's not. Because who needs impartial judges when you can have politicians making decisions about free speech?<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! The police will be there to protect us from ourselves by taking down any content that might offend someone. It's like having a team of superheroes patrolling the internet, protecting us from hate speech and cyberbullying.<br/><br/>THE BENGALURU TIMES WEIGHS IN<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Bengaluru Times has come out in support of the bill. Their editor-in-chief was quoted as saying, "We fully endorse this bill because it will allow us to censor any content that might offend our advertisers."<br/><br/>WHAT'S NEXT?<br/><br/>The bill is expected to become law soon, and people are already bracing themselves for the inevitable censorship. But don't worry, folks! We'll still be able to complain about the government on social media... as long as we use only 140 characters or less.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, and remember: if you say something mean about someone on Twitter, they might just block you... or report you to the authorities.</p>
