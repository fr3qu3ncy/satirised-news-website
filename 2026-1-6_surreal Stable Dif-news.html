        <p>BREAKING: Zelensky Replaces SBU Chief with Guy from the Next Door<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has replaced the head of the country's Security Service (SBU) with a guy from the next door. Vasyl Malyuk, who had been running the SBU since 2022, was suddenly ousted and replaced by Yevhenii Khmara, a mysterious individual who has been known to wear a black hoodie and sunglasses in his free time.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the president, Zelensky decided to make the change after he realized that Malyuk's name sounded too similar to a type of Ukrainian bread. "It was just too confusing," said a spokesperson for the president. "We needed someone who wouldn't get mistaken for a loaf of rye."<br/><br/>Khmara, it turns out, is an expert in... knitting. Yes, you read that right. He's been known to whip up a mean scarf or two (or 17) and has even won prizes at local craft fairs.<br/><br/>The move was met with shock and outrage from the Ukrainian public, who took to social media to express their disappointment. "What is this, a joke?" asked one Twitter user. "I thought we were fighting a war, not trying to find the next big thing in knitting."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Malyuk has taken to Instagram to express his feelings about being replaced by a guy from the next door. "I'm just so... underwhelmed," he wrote in a post that quickly went viral.<br/><br/>In related news, Zelensky has also announced plans to replace Ukraine's entire military with a team of highly trained ninja warriors. When asked for comment, the president simply smiled and said, "You know what they say: 'A good ninja is like a warm loaf of rye bread - you can't have too many.'"<br/><br/>UPDATE: Khmara has since been seen wearing a black hoodie and sunglasses while riding a unicycle through the streets of Kyiv. His whereabouts are currently unknown.<br/><br/>Related stories:<br/><br/>* Ukraine's economy suffers major blow as country runs out of bread<br/>* Zelensky's approval ratings plummet after announcement that he's secretly a chicken farmer<br/>* Ukrainian public demands answers after discovering that Khmara is actually a robot sent from the future to destroy humanity</p>
