        <p>BREAKING: BALLOONS FROM BELARUS CAUSE CHAOS IN LITHUANIA, BUT WE THINK IT'S JUST A REALLY EXCITING PARTY<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, giant balloons carrying contraband cigarettes have been crossing the border from Belarus into Lithuania, causing chaos and prompting the government to declare a state of emergency.<br/><br/>But don't worry, it's not as scary as it sounds. We've spoken to experts (okay, we asked Google) and they tell us that the balloons are actually just a bunch of party-loving Belarusians who can't get enough of Lithuanian cigarettes. Yes, you read that right - they're like the country's version of a keg stand, but with more nicotine.<br/><br/>The balloons, which are apparently launched by smugglers using giant catapults (or maybe it's just a really strong gust of wind), have been causing problems for Lithuania's main airport, which has had to be closed down 15 times already. But don't worry, the authorities are on top of it - they've even set up a team of highly trained balloon-catching ninjas to deal with the situation.<br/><br/>The Lithuanian government is trying to spin this as some sort of "hybrid attack" by Belarus, but we think they're just being paranoid. I mean, who needs an excuse for a good party?<br/><br/>"OF COURSE IT STARTED AS ORGANISED CRIME ACTIVITY ACROSS THE BORDER, BUT WE'VE SEEN MORE THAN ONCE HOW BELARUS INSTRUMENTALISES ORGANISED CRIME TO HAVE AN EFFECT ON NEIGHBOURING COUNTRIES," said Foreign Minister Kestutis Budrys in a statement that was clearly written by a party planner.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! The balloons are also causing problems for the local police, who have to deal with traffic jams and angry drivers trying to get to the airport. And let's not forget the poor souls who are stuck with a bunch of unwanted Christmas presents in their car trunks after being searched by the authorities.<br/><br/>"I HAVEN'T SEEN ANY BALLOONS, IT HAVEN'T AFFECTED US PERSONALLY," said one woman driver after being stopped by the police. "BUT WE LIVE REALLY CLOSE TO THE BORDER AND THIS WHOLE SITUATION REALLY DOES WORRY US... BUT ONLY BECAUSE WE'RE WAITING FOR THE PARTY TO START!"<br/><br/>In related news, Alexander Lukashenko, the president of Belarus, has denied any involvement in the balloon incident and blamed it all on a bunch of "bandit" smugglers who are just trying to get their hands on some cheap cigarettes. Yeah right, dude.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY... OR NOT. WE'RE ALL JUST WAITING FOR THE BALLOONS TO COME AND PARTY WITH US!</p>
