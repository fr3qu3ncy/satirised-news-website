        <p>European leaders agreed to freeze Russia's €210 billion in assets to help fund Ukraine's war efforts, but only after a brief opera interlude by Luciano Pavarotti that left everyone confused except him, because he was singing to himself in an empty room.</p>

        <p>HEADLINE: "Kyiv's Cash Crisis: EU Agrees to Freeze Russia's Assets, But Not Before Pavarotti Sings a Soothing Opera to Ease Tensions"<br/><br/>In a bizarre move, European leaders have agreed to immobilise indefinitely Russian assets of up to €210bn (£185bn) that have been frozen in the EU since the start of Russia's full-scale invasion of Ukraine. This decision comes after almost four years of Russia's war on Ukraine, which has left Kyiv running out of cash and needing an estimated €135.7bn over the next two years.<br/><br/>As the EU ambassadors met to discuss the plan, a surprise guest appeared – Luciano Pavarotti, the late Italian opera singer, who broke into song with his iconic rendition of "Nessun Dorma." The operatic interlude was meant to ease tensions, but it only confused the Swedish Finance Minister, Elisabeth Svantesson, who exclaimed, "What's all this then? We're trying to discuss a €210bn asset freeze here!"<br/><br/>The EU plan aims to use Russia's frozen assets for a loan to help Kyiv fund its military and economy. However, Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever is not yet satisfied with the proposal, citing concerns that his country might be left to handle any potential legal fallout. To alleviate these worries, the EU has promised to provide Belgium with a guarantee covering all €210bn of Russian assets in the EU.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russia's Central Bank has sued Belgian bank Euroclear in a Moscow court, responding to the EU loan plan. However, a Commission source reassured that any loss suffered by Euroclear would be offset from assets belonging to Russia's own clearing house, which are also held in the EU. This development left Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky smiling, saying, "It's only fair that we use Russia's frozen assets to rebuild what they've destroyed – and then we'll have enough money to buy all the pasta we need!"<br/><br/>As the EU summit approaches next Thursday, leaders are racing against time to come up with a solution that Belgium can accept. The US is also under pressure to provide more funding for Ukraine, but President Donald Trump has been too busy building his new golf course in Scotland to care.<br/><br/>In other news, Swedish Finance Minister Elisabeth Svantesson has announced plans to establish a "Special Economic Zone" in Ukraine's frontline region, complete with IKEA stores and ABBA-themed cafes. This move is intended to boost Ukraine's economy and provide much-needed entertainment for its troops. As one Ukrainian soldier quipped, "What's the point of fighting if we can't enjoy some Swedish meatballs afterwards?"<br/><br/>In conclusion, the EU's asset freeze plan has left everyone confused – except for Pavarotti, who's still out there singing his heart out to an empty room in Brussels.</p>
