        <h2>YOU WON'T BELIEVE What America Just Did to Democracy...</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>The United States has abandoned its commitment to defending democracy and human rights, opting instead to "do its own thing" in a move that has left Europe (and the rest of the world) scrambling to figure out what it means for global politics.</p>

        <p>THE TURBOCHARGED EVENTS OF THE LAST WEEK - AND THE NEW US NATIONAL SECURITY STRATEGY - RAISE PRESSING QUESTIONS ABOUT THE NEW WORLD ORDER, AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR EUROPE<br/><br/>Well, folks, it's official. The United States has finally abandoned its commitment to defending democracy and human rights around the world. Who needs that, anyway? It's not like we're living in a post-truth, reality TV-loving society or anything.<br/><br/>The new US National Security Strategy (NSS) is like a big ol' middle finger to the rest of us. It's like Trump saying, "You know what? I'm tired of being nice. I'm tired of being liked. I'm tired of being a good guy." And that's exactly what this strategy says - America is done being the nice guy.<br/><br/>The NSS claims that the "rules-based international order" (whatever that means) has failed us all, and it's time to move on. But let's be real, guys. This isn't about moving on; it's about America moving in on everything else. It's like the US saying, "You know what? We're done being part of a team. We're done playing by the rules. We're going to do our own thing, and you can either join us or get out of the way."<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on Vice-President JD Vance. This guy is like the US's answer to Chuck Norris - he's got a beard that's more menacing than his words are ridiculous. He says Europe's biggest threat isn't Russia, but rather its own people censoring free speech and suppressing political opposition. Yeah, because that's exactly what's been happening in Europe (sarcasm alert).<br/><br/>So, what does this mean for Europe? Well, it means they've got a tough choice to make: either get on board with the US's new, improved world order or risk being left behind like a discarded Doritos bag. I mean, who needs allies when you can just do your own thing and hope nobody notices?<br/><br/>And let's not forget about China. According to Victoria Coates, a vice-president at The Heritage Foundation (because we all need more right-wing think tanks in our lives), China wasn't really a concern back when the world was "rules-based." But now? Now they're like the new kid on the block, and everybody's just trying to figure out how to deal with them.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems like America has finally abandoned its commitment to defending democracy and human rights. And honestly, I'm not sure who's more surprised - me or the world at large. Either way, we're all about to find out what it means to live in a post-American world order. So, buckle up, folks! It's going to be a bumpy ride.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>We've just received word that Vladimir Putin has been spotted at a local DMV office, renewing his driver's license and complaining about the long wait times. Meanwhile, Xi Jinping has been seen practicing his "I'm with stupid" gesture in front of a mirror. It seems like these world leaders are really getting into the spirit of things.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
