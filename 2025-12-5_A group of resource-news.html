        <p>AUSTRALIA BANS SOCIAL MEDIA FOR UNDER 16s - BUT DON'T WORRY, THE TEENAGERS WILL JUST USE SECRET APPS NOW<br/><br/>In a bold move to protect the young minds of Australia, the government has decided to ban social media for anyone under the age of 16. But don't worry, the teenagers of today are nothing if not resourceful. They'll just have to find new ways to share their cat videos and argue with each other online.<br/><br/>We spoke to two teenage content creators, Zoey and Ella, about the impending doom that is social media freedom. And let me tell you, they were...enlightened.<br/><br/>"It's like, what are we supposed to do now?" asked Zoey, looking around frantically for her next TikTok opportunity. "I mean, I've already set up a secret Instagram account in my grandma's name. She doesn't even know it exists!"<br/><br/>Ella nodded vigorously, her eyes shining with excitement. "Yeah, and I've been teaching myself how to code so I can create my own social media platform for under 16s! It'll be called 'TeenBook' and it'll be like TikTok but without the adults judging me."<br/><br/>Their plan? To use a combination of secret apps, encrypted messaging services, and clever coding to outsmart the government's attempts to keep them off social media. "We're like the young revolutionaries of Australia," said Zoey with a grin. "And our rebellion will be fueled by cat videos and memes!"<br/><br/>But what about the parents? Won't they notice that their kids are still using social media, just in a slightly more...diplomatic way?<br/><br/>"Oh, don't worry about that," said Ella with a wave of her hand. "We've got it all figured out. We'll just tell them we're doing 'research' for school and that it's totally not related to our secret Instagram accounts."<br/><br/>Zoey nodded in agreement. "Yeah, and if they get suspicious, we can always blame it on the neighbor's cat. They're always posting weird stuff on their Facebook page anyway."<br/><br/>As for the government, well...let's just say they have no idea what they've gotten themselves into.<br/><br/>"We'll just have to adapt," said a spokesperson for the Australian government when asked about the impending social media revolution. "I mean, we can't let these teenagers outsmart us, can we? I'm sure we'll figure something out."<br/><br/>But until then, the teenagers of Australia will continue to thrive in the shadows of social media, spreading their influence and propaganda through secret apps and coded messages.<br/><br/>And who knows? Maybe one day they'll even have a revolution. But for now, let's just enjoy the cat videos.</p>
