        <p>BREAKING: Gazans Forced to Live in Tents that are Actually Just Giant Game of Jenga<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the health ministry in Gaza has announced that one baby has died from hypothermia and 11 other people have died in building collapses over the past week. But what's even more astonishing is that these buildings were actually just giant game of Jenga held together by hope and prayers.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the buildings would collapse suddenly, causing chaos and destruction wherever they went. "It was like a scene from 'The Matrix'!" said one witness. "I mean, I've seen some wobbly structures in my time, but this was on a whole other level!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, UN agencies have stepped up deliveries of tents, blankets, and clothes to help the displaced Gazans cope with the harsh winter conditions. But little do they know that these tents are actually just giant Tupperware containers that will inevitably leak and flood at any moment.<br/><br/>"We're working tirelessly to bring in more aid and distribute it," said a UN spokesperson. "But let's be real, folks, we're dealing with a group of people who are basically just a bunch of Sims characters living in a perpetual state of chaos."<br/><br/>And if you thought that was bad, the Gaza health ministry has also announced that one baby died from hypothermia while playing a game of "Find the Warmest Spot in the Tent" with his siblings. Yeah, because that's not a thing that happens every day.<br/><br/>In related news, the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) has issued a statement saying that the collapse of damaged buildings due to severe weather conditions is "deeply concerning." And by "deeply concerning," they mean "totally expected and somewhat amusing."<br/><br/>But in all seriousness, folks, let's take a moment to appreciate the resilience of the Gazans. I mean, who needs a stable government or functioning infrastructure when you can just build a bunch of rickety structures and call it a day?<br/><br/>UPDATE: Cogat, the Israeli military body that controls Gaza's border crossings, has dismissed claims of deliberate aid restrictions as "inconsistent with facts on the ground, and the ongoing co-ordination taking place daily." Yeah, because nothing says "co-ordination" like a bunch of soldiers standing around in the rain, trying to figure out how to fix a leaky Tupperware container.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
