        <p>The Norwegian royal family is in disarray as Crown Princess Mette-Marit's son Marius Borg Høiby faces 38 charges, including rape and assault, while his father Crown Prince Haakon is skipping the trial to "protect their good names."</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>Norway's Royal Family in Shambles as Stepson Marius Borg Høiby Faces 38 Charges<br/><br/>Oslo, Norway - In a scandal that has left the Norwegian royal family red-faced, 29-year-old Marius Borg Høiby is set to stand trial for 38 charges, including the rape of four women and assaulting a girlfriend. And in a bizarre twist, his mother Crown Princess Mette-Marit will be MIA from the proceedings due to her own health issues - specifically, pulmonary fibrosis that's so bad she's going to need a lung transplant.<br/><br/>But what's even more surprising is that Høiby's stepfather, Crown Prince Haakon, has made it clear he'll be skipping the trial altogether. "We love him, of course," said the prince, who's next in line for the throne. "He's an important part of our family... and also a total jerk who needs to be locked up."<br/><br/>And if you're wondering why Høiby's family is keeping their distance, it's because they don't want to sully their good names by associating with him. After all, as the palace so elegantly put it, "Høiby is not a public figure... unless he's getting arrested or sued for assault."<br/><br/>The allegations against Høiby are serious, folks. We're talking rape, assault, and even damaging someone's flat (because who doesn't love a good chandelier-destroying tantrum?). And if he gets found guilty, he could face over 10 years in the clink.<br/><br/>But don't worry, the royal family has got this under control. They'll just pretend Høiby is their long-lost cousin and hope no one remembers his name later.<br/><br/>The trial is expected to last for seven weeks, which is just long enough for all of Norway's social influencers to take a selfie with their "I'm with the victim" hashtags and pretend they're actually doing something about it.<br/><br/>Update: In a shocking turn of events, I just got word that Marius Borg Høiby has been spotted at the local IKEA buying a new flat-screen TV. When asked for comment, he simply shrugged and said, "Hey, someone's gotta keep the court proceedings entertained."<br/><br/>And that's not all folks! It turns out Høiby's defense team is planning to call in none other than Justin Bieber as an expert witness on "how to be a good boy" ( Spoiler alert: it doesn't involve assaulting women or destroying property).<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the trial of the century.</p>
