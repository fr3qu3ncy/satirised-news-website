        <p>GAS EXPLOSION KILLS 8, INCLUDING BRIDE AND GROOM, AFTER WEDDING PARTY GETS OUT OF HAND<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, eight people were killed after a gas cylinder exploded at a house the morning after a wedding celebration in Islamabad. The blast was so powerful that it destroyed the entire neighborhood, including a nearby McDonald's and a car dealership.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses reported seeing a group of partygoers dancing to Bollywood music, when suddenly, a giant inflatable unicorn floated out of nowhere and started playing a tinny rendition of "Who Let the Dogs Out?" The unicorn's loud singing was said to have triggered a gas leak in the house, which eventually led to the explosion.<br/><br/>"We were all just having a good time, eating chicken biryani and drinking lassi, when suddenly the unicorn appeared out of thin air," said one guest. "Next thing we knew, there was a huge bang and the whole place came crashing down."<br/><br/>Rescue workers were forced to navigate through a sea of debris, dodging flying bottles of arrack and broken furniture to reach the survivors. Among those killed in the blast were the newlywed couple, who had gotten married just the day before.<br/><br/>"It's a tragic accident that could have been prevented if only they had used a gas cylinder with more... um... 'oomph'," said a spokesperson for the Pakistani government.<br/><br/>The investigation into the incident has revealed that the gas cylinder was purchased from a shady vendor on the black market, and was subsequently modified by a group of rogue mechanics to make it extra potent.<br/><br/>"We're still trying to figure out how they managed to put that much explosive force in a small space," said a forensic expert. "It's like something out of a Bond movie."<br/><br/>The government has since announced plans to regulate the sale of gas cylinders, as well as install more surveillance cameras in neighborhoods to prevent any future incidents involving rogue inflatables and Bollywood dance parties.<br/><br/>In related news, Imran Khan, the former Prime Minister of Pakistan, has been spotted at the scene of the incident, where he was seen taking selfies with rescue workers and eating a plate of biryani.<br/><br/>"Imran is just trying to get some good PR out of this," said a source close to the government. "He's always looking for ways to boost his popularity ratings."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kanye West has been in touch with Imran Khan to offer his services as an emergency DJ at future disaster scenes.<br/><br/>"I'm all about the vibe, man," said West in a statement. "If I can help bring some positivity and good music to these people, then that's what I'll do."</p>
