        <p>"TRUMP WILL BE GONE IN THREE YEARS": TOP DEMOCRATS TRY TO REASSURE EUROPE WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM THE MUNICH SECURITY SUMMIT<br/><br/>In a bizarre display of unity, top Democrats flocked to the Munich Security Summit in Germany, armed with nothing but a handful of awkwardly-placed platitudes and a desperate attempt to reassure Europe that Donald Trump will indeed be gone... eventually. It's like trying to calm down a group of rowdy toddlers by telling them that Santa Claus is just around the corner, but not quite yet.<br/><br/>California Governor Gavin Newsom, resplendent in a royal blue suit and black tie, took center stage to declare, "Donald Trump is temporary! He'll be gone in three years!" - which roughly translates to: "Don't worry, folks, he'll be out of office before you know it... or not." It's like trying to reassure a nervous cat that the laser pointer will indeed turn off eventually.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, New York Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez tried to charm the audience with her charm and wit, only to trip over her own words when asked about defending Taiwan against China. It was like watching a puppy try to walk on its hind legs - adorable, yet utterly clueless. She managed to mumble something about "material gains for the working class" before stumbling offstage, looking like she'd just sucked on a lemon.<br/><br/>Virginia Senator Mark Warner warned that Trump's attempts to nationalize elections and institute voter ID requirements would undermine the integrity of November's midterm congressional elections - which roughly translates to: "Guys, this is getting out of hand!" While his message was clear, his delivery was akin to trying to explain quantum physics to a room full of kindergarteners.<br/><br/>The highlight (or lowlight) of the conference came when Secretary of State Marco Rubio took the stage, sporting a look that could only be described as "nervous-but-trying-to-be-calm." He reassured Europeans that US-Europe relations are bruised but still friendly - like trying to explain to your significant other why you really did leave the dishes in the sink (again). His speech was so soothing that one wondered if he'd been sipping on a calming tea blend.<br/><br/>As the conference drew to a close, it became clear that these Democrats were attempting to provide a more distinct counterpoint to Trump's... well, everything. It was like trying to put out a house fire with a squirt gun - admirable in theory, but ultimately ineffective. And while they may have provided some reassurance to Europe, it's hard not to wonder if they're just whistling Dixie.<br/><br/>So, to sum it up: top Democrats gathered at the Munich Security Summit, trying their best to reassure Europe that Trump will be gone soon (but not too soon, because, you know, three years). They attempted to charm the audience with their platitudes and witty remarks, but ultimately ended up stumbling over their own words. And through it all, Marco Rubio tried his best to sound calm and collected, like a nervous-but-trying-to-be-calm cat in a bathtub.<br/><br/>And so, as we wrap up this ridiculous exercise in trying to make sense of the US Democratic Party's take on the world, one thing becomes clear: Donald Trump will indeed be gone... eventually. But until then, it's going to be a bumpy ride!</p>
