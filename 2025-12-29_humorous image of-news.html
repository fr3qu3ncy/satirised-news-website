        <p>The Not-So-Decisive Victory for the Albanian Nationalist Vetevendosje Party: A Comedy Version<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Albanian nationalist Vetevendosje party has won yet another landslide victory in Kosovo's parliamentary elections. And by "shocking," I mean not really surprising at all. I mean, who doesn't love a good ol' fashioned authoritarian regime? Am I right?<br/><br/>With 90% of the votes counted (and by "counted" I mean "not actually counted but just made up"), the party's leader, Albin Kurti, is set to continue his reign of terror... err, leadership. For a third term, no less! It's like he's trying to break some sort of record or something.<br/><br/>The two main opposition parties, the centre-right Democratic Party of Kosovo (PDK) and the Democratic League of Kosovo (LDK), were left in the dust, with only 20.98% and 13.89% of the votes respectively. Yeah, that's right, folks. The people have spoken, and they've said "meh" to those two parties.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Vetevendosje's victory is so decisive that it's almost like they rigged the whole thing. I mean, who needs a functioning government when you can just have one party in power forever? It's not like that would lead to corruption or anything.<br/><br/>And speaking of corruption, let's talk about the real heroes of this story: the ethnic minority parties guaranteed 20 seats in the National Assembly. They're like the special interest groups in American politics, but without the cool cars and fancy suits.<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about the EU and the US? Won't they be all upset that Kosovo has a functioning government again?" And to that, I say, "Pffft, who cares?" Those guys are always getting their knickers in a twist over something or other. Let them worry about it.<br/><br/>In related news, Donald Trump is reportedly planning to meet with President Zelensky on Sunday to discuss ending the Russian war in Ukraine. Because, you know, that's exactly what they need: more Trump in their lives.<br/><br/>And finally, a man named Hasan is cycling to Kosovo for charity after his dad died of pancreatic cancer. That's... um... quite a story. I'm sure it has nothing to do with the fact that he's trying to raise money for a vet clinic and not actually care about politics at all.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Dua Lipa has been granted Kosovo citizenship, because why not? It's not like she's going to use her newfound power to overthrow Albin Kurti or anything. And, in other news, NATO is reportedly planning to bomb another Belgrade landmark with a Trump makeover. Because, priorities, folks.<br/><br/>THE END</p>
