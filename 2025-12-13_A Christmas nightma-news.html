        <p>COMEDY VERSION OF THE NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>UKRAINE GETS A MILLION HOUSEHOLDS WITHOUT POWER IN A NIGHTMARE SCENARIO FOR RUSSIA<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Ukraine's energy grid was hit by a barrage of overnight Russian strikes, leaving over 1 million households without electricity. Because, you know, what's Christmas without a few blown fuses?<br/><br/>The attacks came as US President Donald Trump's envoy, Steve Witkoff (aka "The Peace Ambassador"), prepared to hold talks with Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky in Berlin. It's like the ultimate party game – who can disrupt the most power grids and still manage to have a peace treaty signed?<br/><br/>According to Ukraine's internal affairs minister, Ihor Klymenko, five regions were hit, including Dnipropetrovsk, Kirovohrad, Mykolaiv, Odesa, and Chernihiv. We're pretty sure that's not the list of places where you'd want to be without power on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>In a shocking twist, Russia's defence ministry revealed it used Kinzhal hypersonic missiles in the strikes – which are basically like really fast, super-sharp drones that can change direction mid-flight and make a lot of noise. Like your aunt at Thanksgiving dinner, but with more explosions.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukraine gave the US its revised version of a 20-point peace plan, because who needs Christmas presents when you have a demilitarized zone to negotiate? The fate of territory in eastern Ukraine remains the biggest sticking point, as Kyiv refuses to cede land which has been occupied by Russia's army, aka "The Most Entertaining Game of Keep Away Ever."<br/><br/>President Zelensky was skeptical about the US-proposed terms, saying, "What will restrain [Russia] from advancing? Or from infiltrating disguised as civilians?" Essentially, he's asking who'll be in charge of handing out fake mustaches to Russian spies.<br/><br/>In a bold move, Ukraine formally applied to join the European Union last year, but despite promises of an accelerated process, it's still several years away from being part of the club. You know, the one with all the free fries and beer.<br/><br/>The Wall Street Journal reported that UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, French President Emmanuel Macron, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz will attend the Berlin talks – which is basically like a who's-who of European leaders trying to figure out how to get back at Russia without getting their hands dirty. <br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THE UKRAINE-RUSSIA-TRUMP SHOW</p>
