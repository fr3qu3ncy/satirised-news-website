        <p>Frank Gehry has died at 96, leaving behind a legacy of wacky buildings that will continue to confuse and entertain city planners and architecture enthusiasts alike.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>LEGENDARY ARCHITECT FRANK GEHRY DIES AGED 96, LEAVES BEHIND A LEGACY OF WACKY BUILDINGS AND CONFUSED CITY PLANNERS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Frank Gehry, the renowned architect behind some of the world's most bewildering buildings, has passed away at the ripe age of 96. As news of his death spread, people from all over the globe took to social media to express their confusion and bewilderment at the thought of Gehry no longer being able to design buildings that make them question everything they thought they knew about architecture.<br/><br/>Gehry's avant-garde style, which involved throwing a bunch of metal sheets in the air and seeing what sticks, left a lasting impact on the world of architecture. His titanium-covered design for the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, is still widely regarded as one of the most confusing and unnecessarily complicated museum designs in history.<br/><br/>But Gehry's claim to fame wasn't just limited to his work on the Guggenheim. Oh no, he had a whole portfolio full of weird and wonderful buildings that made people scratch their heads and wonder what he was thinking. Who could forget his design for the Hotel Marques in Spain, which looked like it was made by a group of mischievous kindergarteners playing with metal sheets? Or his building in Prague's Dancing House, which seemed to defy all laws of physics and good taste?<br/><br/>Gehry's passing has left a void in the world of architecture, but not before he managed to leave behind a final, parting gift for us all: a design for a new skyscraper that looks like a giant metal chicken. Because, why not?<br/><br/>The world will miss Frank Gehry, if only because his buildings provided endless entertainment and confusion for people around the globe. But don't worry, we're sure he's now busy designing buildings in heaven, where the angels are probably scratching their heads just as hard as everyone else.<br/><br/>A LEGACY OF CONFUSION: 5 GEHRY BUILDINGS THAT WILL LEAVE YOU SCRATCHING YOUR HEAD<br/><br/>1. The Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain: Because who needs symmetry and good taste when you can have a building that looks like it was designed by a kindergartener having a temper tantrum?<br/>2. The Hotel Marques in Spain: This one's a real head-scratcher, folks. It's like Gehry took all the leftover metal sheets from his garage and said, "Hey, let's build a hotel with this stuff!"<br/>3. Prague's Dancing House: We're not sure what's more impressive – the fact that this building exists or the fact that someone actually approved it.<br/>4. The Louis Vuitton Foundation in Paris: Because who needs a boring old museum when you can have one shaped like a giant glass shoebox?<br/>5. The Jay Pritzker Pavilion in Chicago: This one's a real showstopper, folks. It's like Gehry took all the leftover scraps from his other buildings and said, "Hey, let's build a concert venue with this stuff!"<br/><br/>Rest in peace, Frank Gehry. May your legacy of confusion continue to inspire and bewilder people for generations to come.</p>
