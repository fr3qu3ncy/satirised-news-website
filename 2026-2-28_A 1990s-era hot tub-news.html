        <h2>BILL CLINTON EXPOSED: Hot Tub Hero Turns into Epstein Enabler Extraordinaire!</h2>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Bill Clinton was grilled in a congressional deposition over his association with Jeffrey Epstein, but only seemed to get hotter under the spotlight of his own scandals and attempts to deflect attention onto Donald Trump.</p>

        <p>The Real News: Clinton Edition<br/><br/>Well, folks, it's finally happened! Bill Clinton, the OG hot tub enthusiast, has come clean about his involvement with Jeffrey Epstein. And by "come clean," I mean he's been grilled for hours in a congressional deposition, and the only thing that's gotten hotter is his defense attorney's temper.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was just James Comer, the Republican chairman of the House Oversight Committee), Clinton had nothing but apologies for his association with Epstein. That's right; Bill "I Did Nothing Wrong" Clinton said he would have cut ties with Epstein and never flown on his plane if he'd known what the dude was up to. Yeah, sure, Billy-boy.<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "What about that hot tub photo?" Well, let me tell you, it's a real doozy! Clinton claims he didn't know the mystery woman (who looks suspiciously like a 1990s-era Spice Girl), and when asked if they'd had sex, he said, "Uh, nope." Not exactly the most convincing denial from the former President of the United States.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! During his testimony, Clinton also brought up Donald Trump's relationship with Epstein. That's right; Bill Clinton is now a key witness in the Trump-Russia investigation... or at least that's what I'm calling it. "Additional information" about Trump was allegedly discussed during Clinton's deposition, and Democrats are already demanding that Trump come in for questioning.<br/><br/>And just when you thought things couldn't get any juicier, Clinton said he didn't know whether Trump should be called before the committee to testify... because that's a totally normal thing to say. I mean, who needs a President of the United States to decide what's good for the country when Bill Clinton can do it?<br/><br/>Now, as we all know, the truth is out there (or at least in some heavily-redacted government document). And by "the truth," I mean that Hillary Clinton also had no idea about Epstein's crimes. Yeah, because nothing says "I'm a devoted wife" like having no knowledge of your husband's shady dealings.<br/><br/>So, to sum it up: Bill Clinton is still hot-tubbing his way through life, and the rest of us are just trying to keep up with the Clintons' never-ending parade of scandals.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story... or not. I mean, who needs actual news when you can have Bill Clinton's testimony as a never-ending soap opera?</p>
