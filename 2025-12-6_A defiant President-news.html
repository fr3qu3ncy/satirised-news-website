        <p>BREAKING: Trump Declares War on Baby Shots, Orders CDC to Get "Alternative" Childhood Vaccination Schedule from Denmark<br/><br/>In a shocking move, President Donald Trump has ordered the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) to review all childhood vaccination recommendations in the US, after a panel of vaccine advisers voted to end the longstanding recommendation for vaccinations against hepatitis B virus (HBV) right after birth.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Trump was overheard saying "We're going to make vaccinations great again, believe me" as he directed his top health officials to review best practices from peer countries like Denmark. The new recommendations are expected to include a delay in the hepatitis B shot for babies born to mothers who have tested negative for the virus.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Trump praised the Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices (Acip) for their Friday decision, calling it "very good" in a social media post that featured a picture of himself holding a giant bottle of Danish insulin. The Acip is responsible for making recommendations to the CDC on when and who should be vaccinated.<br/><br/>The new guidance also suggests that babies who do not receive a birth dose of the vaccine should get their initial dose of the shot "no earlier than two months of age", a recommendation that has been met with skepticism by public health experts. "This is a recipe for disaster," said Dr. Cody Meissner, a member of the Acip panel. "We know it's safe and we know it's very effective. And to make the changes that are being proposed, we will see more children and adolescents and adults infected with hepatitis B."<br/><br/>In response to the committee's vote, Maryland's state health department issued an advisory on Friday, citing a recommendation by the American Academy of Pediatrics, urging health care providers and hospitals to continue to offer the hep B vaccines at birth. However, sources close to the White House have revealed that Trump is "not happy" with this move and has ordered his top health officials to review the recommendations again.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a related development, a group of celebrities, including Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and Justin Bieber, have come out in support of the delayed hepatitis B shot. "As a proud father of two, I believe that every baby deserves a chance to contract a preventable disease," said The Rock in a statement.<br/><br/>And in a bizarre side note, sources close to the White House have revealed that Trump has asked his aides to look into purchasing a giant bottle of Danish insulin for the Oval Office. "It's going to be yuge, believe me," he was overheard saying.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In response to this article, the CDC has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing and assuring the public that all childhood vaccination recommendations are safe and effective. However, sources close to the White House have revealed that Trump is still "not happy" with this move and has ordered his top health officials to review the recommendations again.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* Trump Declares War on Science: President Trump orders CDC to review all childhood vaccination recommendations in the US.<br/>* The Rock Comes Out in Support of Delayed Hepatitis B Shot: Celebrities line up to support delayed hepatitis B shot for babies born to mothers who have tested negative for the virus.<br/>* Maryland's State Health Department Defies Trump, Issues Advisory on Continued Use of Hep B Vaccines at Birth: Health care providers and hospitals urged to continue offering hep B vaccines at birth despite new CDC recommendations.</p>
