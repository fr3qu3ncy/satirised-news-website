        <p>Machu Picchu Mayhem: A Train Wrecks, a Bus Full of Accountants Crashes, and One Driver Dies in the Most Epic Way Possible<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a train driver met their maker on Tuesday when two trains collided head-on on the single-track line to Machu Picchu. The crash, which occurred near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, left at least 40 people injured, including a bus full of accountants who were on their way to a conference.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the train driver, who has not been named but is reportedly a huge fan of 80s rock music, was playing "Eye of the Tiger" on repeat when the crash occurred. "He was singing along at the top of his lungs and totally lost concentration," said one witness. "It's like he thought he was on stage with Survivor or something."<br/><br/>The accountants, who were all wearing matching "I'm with Stupid" t-shirts, were on their way to a conference where they would be learning how to do math problems without using calculators. They are currently being treated for minor injuries, including whiplash and severe boredom.<br/><br/>Peru's president has issued a statement apologizing for the incident and promising to investigate the cause of the crash. "We take these incidents very seriously and will get to the bottom of what happened," said the president, who was later seen dancing in his office to "Don't Stop Believin'".<br/><br/>The train company involved in the crash has issued a statement saying that they are cooperating fully with authorities and offering compensation to those affected. They have also announced plans to add an extra train car to their fleet to accommodate all the accountants on board.<br/><br/>In related news, a group of tourists who were stuck at the scene for hours after the crash began chanting "We want our luggage back!" as they waited for evacuation. The incident has sparked widespread outrage and calls for greater regulation of the tourism industry in Peru.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The driver's family has released a statement saying that he died doing what he loved most - driving trains really fast while listening to 80s rock music. A memorial fund has been set up to help pay for his funeral, which will be held at the local arena and feature a performance by Bon Jovi.<br/><br/>PHOTO CAPTION: A train car lies abandoned on the side of the track after the crash. Note the faint image of a tiger in the background, apparently left behind by the train driver's favorite rock band.</p>
