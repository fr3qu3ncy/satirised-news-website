        <p>BREAKING: Thieves Held Up a Security Guard, an Elderly Couple, and a Group of Elvis Impersonators Before Making Off with the World's Most Valuable Artworks<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two masked thieves, dressed in bright orange jumpsuits and oversized sunglasses, held up a security guard and an elderly couple at a museum in São Paulo, Brazil. The duo, who were reportedly armed with nothing more than a can of spray cheese and a whoopee cushion, made off with 13 priceless artworks, including eight engravings by the famous French artist Henri Matisse.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the thieves, who were later identified as Elvis impersonators named "Elvis" and "The King's Cousin," used their impressive dance moves to distract the security guard while they snatched the art pieces. The elderly couple, who were visiting the museum on a date, were reportedly too shocked to react.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad action movie," said one witness. "I mean, I've seen some crazy things in my time, but this takes the cake. I'm just glad no one was hurt... except for maybe Elvis's ego."<br/><br/>The stolen artworks include Matisse's famous series of engravings, "The Snail and the Butterflies." The pieces are estimated to be worth over $10 million, making them some of the most valuable art in the world.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, authorities are working with Interpol to track down the thieves. "We're following a lead that suggests they may have fled to a secret underground lair hidden beneath a pizzeria," said one detective. "But we're not giving up. We'll get them, and when we do, there will be consequences... or at least a really nice dinner on the house."<br/><br/>As for Elvis and his cousin, they remain at large, with some speculating that they may have been hired by a rival art museum to steal the valuable artworks. Others believe that the duo may be working with a secret society of Elvis impersonators bent on stealing the world's most valuable treasures.<br/><br/>Whatever the case, one thing is certain: no one is safe from the cunning and outrageous thievery of Elvis and his cousin.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>Reports are emerging that the thieves have been spotted in Jamaica, where they were seen dancing to a rendition of "Jailhouse Rock" on top of a flooded car. Authorities are urging citizens to be on the lookout for any suspicious individuals dressed in bright orange jumpsuits and oversized sunglasses.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!<br/><br/>And in other news, Panama, Haiti, Curacao, and Scotland fans celebrated their countries' qualification to the 2026 World Cup by having a massive party.
