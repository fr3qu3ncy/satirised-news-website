        <p>BREAKING: Eritrea Blames Igad for Being a "Tool Against" Them, Igad Responds with "You're Not Even Invited to the Party, Let Alone Play the Music!"<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Eritrea has withdrawn from the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (Igad), citing that the regional bloc has failed its founding principles and is essentially a tool against countries like itself. But Igad, not one to be left out of a good drama, fired back with a statement saying, "You're not even invited to the party, let alone play the music!"<br/><br/>The withdrawal comes amid a fierce war of words between Eritrea and neighboring Ethiopia, leading to fears of renewed armed conflict. It's like when your friend's ex-boyfriend shows up at the same coffee shop as their new beau, but this time with a beefy entourage.<br/><br/>Eritrea's foreign ministry said in a statement that Igad had strayed from its founding principles and failed to contribute to regional stability. But Igad retorted, "Hey, we're trying our best here! You're just not participating in any of the meetings or activities because you're too busy being grumpy."<br/><br/>The government in Eritrea's capital, Asmara, has long accused Igad of siding with Ethiopia in regional disputes. It's like when your neighbor always complains about the noise from your parties, but never invites themselves to join the fun.<br/><br/>Igad was established to promote regional stability and food security in East Africa, and also includes Ethiopia, Kenya, Sudan, South Sudan, Uganda, and Djibouti. But Eritrea has been a bit of a party pooper since its border dispute with Ethiopia in 2007, when it left the bloc only to rejoin in 2023.<br/><br/>So, what's next? Will Igad throw a pity party for itself without Eritrea? Or will Eritrea try to start its own regional bloc, like "Eritrean Authority on Development" (EAD)? Stay tuned, folks!<br/><br/>UPDATES<br/><br/>* Ethiopian Prime Minister Abiy Ahmed has been demanding access to the Red Sea through Eritrea, because who doesn't love a good beach vacation?<br/>* Former Ethiopian Foreign Minister Workneh Gebyehu is currently the head of Igad, which is like when your old friend becomes the principal of your alma mater and you're not even invited to the reunion.<br/>* Eritrea has been accused of destabilizing the region by interfering in the internal affairs of Igad member countries. But hey, who doesn't love a good game of "keep away" every now and then?<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* "Why Eritreans Are at War with Each Other Around the World"... because someone stole their parking spot.<br/>* "'It Would Have Been Better If They'd Killed Me': A Forgotten War Destroying Women's Lives"... because war is just a big ol' mess, folks!<br/>* "Olympian and Other Eritreans Freed After 18 Years Without Trial, Relatives Tell the BBC"... because sometimes justice takes a bit longer than expected.<br/><br/>Stay classy, Africa!</p>
