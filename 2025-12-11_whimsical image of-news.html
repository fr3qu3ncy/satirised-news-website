        <p>BREAKING: María Corina Machado, Nobel Prize Winner, Spotted Wearing Unicorn Horns and a "I'm with Stupid" T-Shirt While Sneaking into Norway<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuelan opposition leader María Corina Machado was spotted wearing a sparkly unicorn horn and a bright pink "I'm with Stupid" t-shirt as she sneaked into Norway to collect her Nobel Peace Prize. Witnesses claim that Machado, who has been in hiding for months, emerged from the shadows like a ninja, waving a flag made of rainbow-colored streamers and chanting "¡Viva la revolución!"<br/><br/>"I was just out for a midnight snack when I saw María Corina doing backflips off the balcony of the Grand Hotel," said one eyewitness. "I mean, who needs a Nobel Prize when you can do parkour like that?"<br/><br/>According to sources close to Machado's entourage, her secret journey to Norway involved a series of high-stakes heists, including breaking into a Venezuelan bakery to steal a tray of freshly baked croissants and then using them as a makeshift disguise to sneak past military checkpoints.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of Mission: Impossible," said one source. "She put on a pair of Groucho Marx glasses, grabbed a fake mustache, and voilà! She became 'Juanito' – the most unlikely fugitive in Venezuelan history."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Machado's daughter, Ana Corina Sosa, has come forward to reveal that her mom's Nobel Prize was actually just a ruse to get her hands on some of the free Norwegian pastries she'd heard so much about.<br/><br/>"I mean, who needs world peace when you can have waffles?" said Ana Corina in an exclusive interview with us. "Mom's always been more about the free food than the actual prize itself."<br/><br/>As for Machado's plans to return to Venezuela, sources close to her inner circle say she's actually planning to open up a new chain of fast-food restaurants throughout the country – aptly named "María Corina's Fries & Freedom".<br/><br/>"We're talking fried chicken, tacos, and the world's best empanadas," said one insider. "It's going to be huge – just huge!"<br/><br/>And so, the question remains: will Machado's daring heist into Norway and her subsequent rise to fast-food fame mark a new era of Venezuelan politics? Only time (and a few more Nobel Prizes) will tell.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Norwegian government has announced plans to install a series of giant, inflatable unicorns along the border with Venezuela in an effort to deter future machinations by Machado and her crew.</p>
