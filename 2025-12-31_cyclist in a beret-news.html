        <h2>"BIKE TO THE FUTURE: Eurostar Passengers Pedal Through New Year's Eve Chaos!"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Eurostar passengers had to bike through their troubles on New Year's Eve after a power outage caused delays and cancellations that were so chaotic, some folks even broke into song with "interesting" renditions of "Auld Lang Syne".</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Channel Tunnel Chaos as Eurostar Services Return to Normal (Sort Of)<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the high-speed rail firm Eurostar has urged passengers to check before they travel... again. Yes, you read that right – after last night's major delays and cancellations due to an overhead power supply problem and a failed Le Shuttle train, Eurostar is warning people to be prepared for possible knock-on delays and last-minute cancellations.<br/><br/>Because, why not? It's New Year's Eve, and we all know what that means: more opportunities for things to go terribly wrong. In fact, some passengers were so fed up with the delays that they took matters into their own hands – or rather, onto their own bikes. That's right; one intrepid traveler, Floriaen Dullaert, bought a bike in Brussels for €20 and rode it all the way to Dunkirk, where he caught a late-night ferry to Dover. Who needs Eurostar when you have a trusty steed like that?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, passengers stuck on Eurostar trains overnight were treated to an impromptu New Year's Eve party, complete with snacks, drinks, and what can only be described as "interesting" singing along to "Auld Lang Syne". One passenger reported seeing the cast of "Hamilton" performing an impromptu rendition of "Non-Stop" on the platform, but we're not sure if that was a real or just a really well-timed hallucination.<br/><br/>And in other news, Getlink – the company responsible for running the Channel Tunnel – has confirmed that work is still underway to fix the power issue. When asked about the progress, a spokesperson said, "We're working on it, but honestly, we have no idea when it'll be fixed. Maybe tomorrow? Possibly next week? If we're lucky?" Ah, the joys of rail travel in 2023.<br/><br/>In related news, the Panoramic Viewpoint at London's St Pancras International has been closed for New Year's Eve due to "unforeseen circumstances" – which, let's be honest, is just a nice way of saying they ran out of snacks.</p>
