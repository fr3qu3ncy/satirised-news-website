        <p>Mexico's president had her dignity shaken, not by an earthquake, but by tripping on her own feet while trying to exit a room during a press conference interrupted only slightly by a 6.5 magnitude trembler.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Earthquake Interrupts Mexico's President During Press Conference, But Only Slightly<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the 6.5 magnitude trembler that shook Guerrero, Mexico earlier this week managed to interrupt President Claudia Sheinbaum during her first press conference of the year - but only because she was trying to remember where she put her notes.<br/><br/>The earthquake, which set off the country's earthquake alert system, caused some residents to rush into the streets, but mostly just because they were trying to get away from the annoying sound of Sheinbaum's voice. The epicenter was near the town of San Marcos, close to the Pacific coast resort of Acapulco, where a group of partying spring breakers were completely unaware that anything had happened.<br/><br/>No injuries or major damage were reported, mainly because everyone was too busy trying to find their car keys in the chaos to notice. The only casualty was Sheinbaum's dignity, which took a hit when she tripped on her own feet while trying to exit the room.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, the Mexican Seismic Alert System, which is designed to alert people of potential earthquakes, somehow ended up playing a continuous loop of "La Cucaracha" instead of the traditional warning siren. When asked about this strange occurrence, officials claimed it was just a "technical glitch," but sources close to the government revealed that it was actually just a bunch of interns trying to have some fun.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news, a baby seal was spotted walking into a bar in Richmond, New Zealand, where it ordered a drink and proceeded to tell terrible jokes to the bartender. When asked about this incident, experts said it was likely just a case of marine mammal confusion, as seals are not actually capable of understanding human language.<br/><br/>In related news, NASA astronauts Jonny Kim and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky returned to Earth after 245 days in space, where they were greeted by a group of excited middle schoolers who had written a song about them. The astronauts were thrilled to see the kids' enthusiasm, but were disappointed that their own return was overshadowed by the news of Sheinbaum's embarrassing fall.<br/><br/>As for Sheinbaum herself, she took it all in stride and simply shrugged off the incident, saying "oh well, at least I got some good exercise out of it." When asked what she planned to do next, she replied "probably just go back to bed and forget the whole thing ever happened."<br/><br/>And so, another day in Mexico comes to a close, with the country's residents still trying to figure out how to deal with the ongoing earthquake crisis - which is now being referred to as "The Sheinbaum Shuffle."</p>
