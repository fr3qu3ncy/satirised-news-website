    <div class="article">
        <p>"GREENLANDERS SPLIT ON TRUMP'S THREATS: 'HE'S CRAZY', WE JUST WANT TO BE LEFT ALONE'"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Donald Trump's renewed threats to take over Greenland have left the islanders in stitches. The BBC's Europe Editor Katya Adler visited the Arctic island's capital, Nuuk, and found that locals were more concerned about their favorite TV show, "The Great British Baking Show", than Trump's plans for global domination.<br/><br/>"I'm just trying to get through this episode without any spoilers," said one Greenlander, who wished to remain anonymous. "Trump can have the whole island if he wants it, but first, I need to know who gets eliminated next."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, another local, Søren Jensen, was more direct in his response. "Listen, Trump is crazy, and we just want to be left alone," he said, sipping on a cup of coffee at a local café. "We have enough problems with the Danish government trying to take over our snacks – we don't need some American billionaire trying to steal our land."<br/><br/>As Adler continued her interview, she noticed that several locals were more interested in discussing the merits of the UK's tea vs. Greenland's coffee than Trump's plans. "Honestly, I think the best way to settle this is with a bake-off," said one enthusiastic Greenlander, holding up a tray of freshly baked pastries.<br/><br/>When asked about the potential consequences of Trump's threats, the islanders seemed more concerned about the impending arrival of Nickelback for a concert tour. "Ugh, don't even get me started on those guys," said another local, shuddering at the thought. "If they show up, I'm hiding in my igloo until it's all over."<br/><br/>As Adler concluded her interview, she was approached by a group of elderly Greenlanders, who were busy knitting scarves and discussing the merits of various TV shows. "Excuse me, young one," said one of them, "but have you seen that new season of 'The Crown'? I heard it's simply divine."<br/><br/>Adler smiled and nodded, taking note of their comments while thinking to herself, "I think I've got enough material for a comedy special here."</p>
