        <p>COLOMBIAN CATHEDRAL CAUSES A STIR... OR SHOULD WE SAY, IT'S DEEP!<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist of faith and geology, the Colombian government has announced plans to build an underground cathedral 180 meters below ground. And we thought our basements were deep!<br/><br/>The idea came from the miners building makeshift altars in the mine in the 1930s, to pray for their safety before starting their shifts. Who knew that these early miners had a vision of a massive underground church?<br/><br/>Imagine the look on the faces of the congregation when they're told to take a 180-meter elevator ride to get to mass! "Sorry folks, we're running late... and so are the elevators!"<br/><br/>The cathedral will be built in a vast underground cave system, which has been discovered beneath Bogotá. It's like a real-life Game of Thrones set – minus the dragons (or so we hope).<br/><br/>Engineers have warned that building such a structure is "utter madness," but hey, when have engineers ever been wrong? We're sure they just wanted to add some drama to their PowerPoint presentations.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, local residents are thrilled at the prospect of having an underground cathedral... until they realized it would make their basements sound like a never-ending echo chamber. "Can you please turn down that echoey noise, it's giving me a headache!"<br/><br/>Construction is set to begin next year, with the first worshippers expected to descend into the depths in 2027. So, if you ever find yourself lost in Colombia and stumble upon an underground cathedral... just remember: it's not just any ordinary church – it's 180 meters deep!</p>
