        <p>BREAKING: Venezuelan President Caught in New York, Now Sipping Mai Tais with Donald Trump<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was taken into custody at a New York detention centre after being captured during US strikes on Caracas. But what's really got everyone talking is that he's now sipping Mai Tais with none other than former US President Donald Trump.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter, Trump had invited Maduro to his penthouse suite in Manhattan for an impromptu game of "Who Can Eat the Most Taco Tuesday Tacos." Little did they know, a DEA helicopter would be landing on the helipad outside Trump's pad at any moment.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that as Maduro and Trump were neck-deep in tacos, they suddenly heard the thud of helicopters and the sound of DEA agents shouting "Get outta here, Nicolás!" The Venezuelan President was quickly apprehended and whisked away to a nearby detention centre, where he's currently enjoying a series of lengthy phone calls with his wife, Cilia Flores.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Sources close to the White House reveal that Trump has been secretly recording all of Maduro's conversations from the other side of the cell door. The tapes are said to contain juicy discussions about everything from the best way to make a mean Cuban sandwich to the intricacies of Venezuelan baseball strategy.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, sources also claim that Madonna has been called in to help negotiate Maduro's release from custody. "The Queen of Pop is like a superhero," an insider revealed. "She'll do whatever it takes to get Nicolás outta there and back to Venezuela, where he can resume his daily routine of eating massive burgers and shouting at the top of his lungs."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has taken to Twitter to proclaim that his taco-eating skills are unmatched by any world leader – including, of course, Maduro. "Believe me, folks," he tweeted. "I've eaten so many tacos in my life, I could single-handedly put Venezuela's taco industry out of business just by showing up."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Venezuelan President's Wife Sends Love to Trump<br/><br/>In a surprise move, Cilia Flores, wife of the detained Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, has taken to social media to send love and solidarity to none other than Donald Trump. "To our dear friend @realDonaldTrump," she tweeted. "May your taco Tuesday be filled with laughter and good vibes. We'll get through this together, mi amigo!"<br/><br/>Flores' tweet quickly went viral, with many Venezuelans praising her for showing the human side of their country's embattled leader.<br/><br/>But what really got everyone talking was when Trump himself responded to Flores' tweet by sending a private message – complete with a selfie taken in front of a taco stand. "Hey Cilia," he wrote. "Just wanted to say hi and that I'm rooting for you guys! Can't wait to try your famous Arepas next time we meet"<br/><br/>Flores, it seems, is not amused.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Madonna Called In to Negotiate Maduro's Release<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Madonna has been called in to help negotiate the release of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro from New York custody. Sources close to the matter reveal that she's been "summoned" by Trump himself to put her legendary negotiation skills to work.<br/><br/>According to insiders, Trump is hoping Madonna can use her charms to convince Maduro to sign a deal giving up Venezuela's oil reserves in exchange for his freedom. "Madonna's got connections with everyone," one source revealed. "She'll talk to Putin, she'll talk to Kim Jong-un – no one's off-limits when it comes to getting Nicolás outta there."<br/><br/>But not everyone is convinced that Madonna can pull this off.<br/><br/>"I don't know what Trump is thinking," a former White House staffer snarked. "Madonna's all about promoting her next album and selling some merch – she's got no interest in saving Nicolás Maduro from certain doom!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Trump's Taco Tuesday Tacos Have Gone Viral<br/><br/>As the world waits with bated breath for news of Nicolás Maduro's release, one thing is clear: Trump's taco Tuesday has become an international sensation.<br/><br/>Videos and photos of Trump taking down massive tacos in front of a New York City skyline have been viewed millions of times online. And it seems, despite being on opposite sides of the aisle (or in this case, opposite sides of a taco stand), Maduro himself is not immune to the allure of Trump's Taco Tuesday.<br/><br/>"Hey @realDonaldTrump," Maduro tweeted earlier today. "I've heard your tacos are fire – can't wait to try one for myself when I get outta here!"<br/><br/>Trump quickly responded with a selfie taken in front of his favorite taco stand, holding up a massive burrito and giving a thumbs-up.<br/><br/>And so the saga continues...</p>
