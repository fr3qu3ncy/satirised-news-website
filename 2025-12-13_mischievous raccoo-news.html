        <p>BREAKING: Trashed Panda on the Loose, Burglarizing Snacks from DMV<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the notorious "trashed panda" - a raccoon with a penchant for breaking into liquor stores and getting drunk - has struck again. This time, the masked bandit is suspected of burglarizing snacks from the Department of Motor Vehicles (DMV).<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the trashed panda was seen rummaging through the DMV's break room, helping himself to an assortment of chips and cookies. "It was like he had a sixth sense for finding the good stuff," said one stunned employee.<br/><br/>But this isn't the first time the trashed panda has been involved in a snack-related scandal. Sources close to the investigation confirm that he was also responsible for breaking into a nearby karate studio, where he allegedly stole a stash of protein bars and energy drinks.<br/><br/>"It's like he has a secret underground network of snack storage facilities," said Officer Samantha Martin, who has been tracking the trashed panda's movements. "We're doing everything we can to catch him in the act, but it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack - or in this case, a raccoon in a sea of snacks."<br/><br/>The trashed panda's modus operandi is becoming increasingly brazen, with witnesses reporting that he has been spotted wearing a tiny backpack and carrying a miniature shopping cart.<br/><br/>"It's like he's got a whole operation going on," said one stunned citizen. "I mean, who needs a bank heist when you can just break into the DMV and steal all the snacks?"<br/><br/>As the search for the trashed panda continues, authorities are urging citizens to remain vigilant and report any suspicious raccoon activity.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The trashed panda has been spotted in the vicinity of a local pizza parlor, where he is allegedly plotting his next move. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
