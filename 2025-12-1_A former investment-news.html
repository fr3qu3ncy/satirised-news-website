        <p>**BREAKING: Former Investment Manager Sentenced to Commute... to a Timeshare Presentation**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former investment manager David Gentile was convicted of defrauding thousands of investors. But don't worry, folks! President Donald Trump has commuted his sentence to a timeshare presentation in Florida. That's right, instead of serving out his seven-year prison term, Gentile will get to spend the next few weeks listening to an endless loop of Kenny G albums and being forced to attend a series of enthusiastic presentations about the benefits of owning a 2-bedroom condo with a view of the parking lot.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Trump was overheard saying, "Folks, this guy Gentile is a real winner. I mean, who wouldn't want to invest in a scheme that promises guaranteed returns... of lies? He's a true American hero, and I'm proud to give him a free pass on the whole 'not going to prison' thing."<br/><br/>Gentile's lawyer, Jeffry Schneider (no relation to the co-defendant, apparently), had this to say: "We're thrilled that our client has been given this... unique opportunity. He's really looking forward to attending those timeshare presentations and learning all about the importance of owning a piece of property in a state with no sales tax."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump took to Twitter to brag about his latest commutation, saying, "Just commuted the sentence of another great American, David Gentile! Nobody knows more about great Americans than I do, folks. Believe me, this guy is going to make America... sell timeshares again."<br/><br/>The White House also released a statement claiming that Gentile was actually a victim of circumstance and that the Department of Justice had made a series of egregious errors in their investigation. When asked for comment, a spokesperson said, "Well, you see, it's like this: GPB Capital was just trying to... um... 'reorganize' its assets, yeah that's it! And David Gentile was just the right guy for the job. He's a real stand-up guy, folks."<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! Another example of Trump's unwavering commitment to justice and accountability. Or not.<br/><br/>**Related Stories:**<br/><br/>* "Trump Commutes Sentence of Former Investment Manager... to a Life of Leisure"<br/>* "White House Spokesperson Claims GPB Capital was Just 'Reorganizing' Its Assets... with the Help of a Timeshare Salesman"<br/>* "Gentile's Lawyer Says Client is 'Thrilled' to Attend Timeshare Presentations, Still Planning to Sue the Department of Justice for 'Defamation'"</p>
