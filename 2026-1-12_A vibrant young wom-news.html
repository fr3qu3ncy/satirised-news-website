        <p>BREAKING: "Miracle Baby" Born in a Tree Above Floodwaters Dies at 25 (But Not Before Having a Rave Party and Eating All the Pizza)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Rosita Salvador Mabuiango, the famous "miracle baby" born in a tree above Mozambique's floodwaters back in 1997 (not 2000, we made a mistake), has passed away at the age of 25. But not before having one last hurrah with her squad.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Rosita spent her final days partying like it was 1999, sipping piña coladas and dancing to Spice Girls on repeat. Her friends claim she even had a custom-made "I'm-not-dead-yet" t-shirt made for the occasion. But what really got everyone talking was the pizza party.<br/><br/>Sources close to Rosita reveal that just hours before her passing, she ordered 20 large pepperoni pizzas and invited her entire high school class (which included her best friend, Dolly Parton) to a secret underground rave in an abandoned warehouse. And let's just say, those pizzas were devoured faster than a Kardashian at a Golden Globes after-party.<br/><br/>But what really gets us is that Rosita's mom, Carolina Cecilia Chirindza, was so distraught over her daughter's passing that she decided to channel her grief into a new career: stand-up comedy. That's right, folks, the same woman who gave birth in a tree above floodwaters has now become a comedy legend, with jokes like, "Why did Rosita go to the doctor? Because she was feeling a little 'drowned'!"<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, we've just received word that President Daniel Chapo has declared a national holiday in Mozambique to celebrate Rosita's life. But with a twist: it'll be a four-day weekend, where everyone gets to party like it's 1999 and eat all the pizza they can handle.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just been told that the government is also planning to build a giant statue of Rosita in the middle of nowhere, surrounded by a moat filled with nacho cheese. Because priorities, people!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, including the name of the new baby panda born at the same hospital where Rosita passed away (it's going to be a reality TV star, folks!).</p>
