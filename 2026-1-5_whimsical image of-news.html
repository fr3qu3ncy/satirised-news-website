        <p>"GREENLAND, BABY! TRUMP WANTS TO ADD IT TO HIS COLLECTION OF TERRITORIES... ALONG WITH VENEZUELA, IRAN, AND THE MOON!"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has announced his plans to annex Greenland, citing its strategic location and abundance of minerals critical to high-tech sectors. But wait, there's more! He also wants to add Venezuela to the collection... along with Iran and the Moon!<br/><br/>"We need Greenland from the standpoint of national security," said Trump, sipping on a Starbucks coffee while addressing reporters. "And let me tell you, folks, we're going to make Denmark pay for it. Bigly."<br/><br/>Greenland's Prime Minister Jens Frederik Nielsen responded by saying, "Uh, no thanks, Mr. President. We're good with our current arrangement of being a semi-autonomous Danish territory." But Trump was undeterred.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Stephen Miller's wife, Katie Miller, posted on social media a map of Greenland in the colors of the American flag alongside the word "SOON". The Danish ambassador to the US responded by saying, "Uh, no you didn't. That's just a really bad Photoshop job."<br/><br/>In other news, Trump has appointed a special envoy to Greenland... played by Danny DeVito. Yes, that Danny DeVito.<br/><br/>As for Venezuela, it seems like Trump is still trying to figure out how to make the country pay for its own invasion. "We'll just send in some Marines and have them hold up a 'For Sale' sign," said Trump. "Should be easy peasy."<br/><br/>And as for Iran, well... let's just say that Trump has a new favorite game show: "Who Wants to Be Invaded by the US?" hosted by none other than Mike Pence.<br/><br/>But in all seriousness, folks, Greenland and Denmark must decide the future of Greenland, and only they can do it. Unless, of course, Trump sends in his special envoy... played by Danny DeVito.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>The European Union has rejected Trump's claim that they need the US to control Greenland. In a statement, European Commission chief spokesperson Paula Pinho said, "Uh, no you didn't. That's just a really bad joke."<br/><br/>And as for Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, he had this to say: "Well, I'm not sure what's more surprising... Trump's annexation plans or the fact that he thinks he can invade Venezuela and make it pay for its own invasion."<br/><br/>GREENLAND ALERT SYSTEM ACTIVATED<br/><br/>If you're in Greenland right now, please evacuate immediately. If you're in Denmark, please just stay calm and try to enjoy your fjord views. And if you're in the US, well... good luck with all that.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
