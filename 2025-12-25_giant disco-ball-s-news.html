        <p>TURKEY DETAINS 115 ISIS SUSPECTS 'PLANNING NEW YEAR'S ATTACKS'<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Turkish authorities have detained over 100 suspected members of the so-called Islamic State group who were allegedly planning to disrupt Christmas and New Year's celebrations. However, things took a bizarre turn when it was revealed that the suspects were actually planning to use a giant, disco-ball-shaped drone to drop exploding cupcakes on unsuspecting revelers.<br/><br/>The mass raids, which targeted 124 addresses across Istanbul, resulted in the seizure of firearms, ammunition, and what officials described as "organisational documents" - which, rumor has it, included a spreadsheet detailing the optimal time to serve Jell-O shots at holiday parties. Police detained 115 suspects, but efforts are ongoing to track down a further 22 who are believed to be hiding in plain sight, masquerading as accountants and dental hygienists.<br/><br/>The prosecutor's office said the suspects were in contact with IS operatives outside Turkey, although it's unclear whether these operatives were actual terrorists or just really enthusiastic fans of the TV show "Game of Thrones." The announcement comes two days after Turkish intelligence agents carried out a raid against the group on the Afghanistan-Pakistan border, where they discovered a secret underground bunker filled with nothing but copies of "The Art of War" and a collection of Justin Bieber's greatest hits.<br/><br/>Turkey's security services regularly target people with suspected links to IS, although in this case, it seems they were more interested in stopping the planned drone attacks than actually combating terrorism. After all, who wouldn't want to disrupt a festive celebration with a giant, exploding cupcake? It's the perfect way to get into the holiday spirit!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Pope Leo has urged "courage" to end the Ukraine war, but it seems his message was lost in translation when it came time to plan the New Year's festivities. In other news, Libya's army chief was killed in an air crash while trying to deliver a batch of exploding cupcakes to the Turkish border.<br/><br/>In related news, US forces carried out a "massive" strike against IS in Syria, which resulted in the destruction of several terrorist hideouts and a few thousand boxes of Jell-O. And in a bizarre twist, a mum-of-two died after undergoing cosmetic surgery in Turkey, where she had hoped to achieve a more "holiday-themed" look.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's been a wild ride for Turkish authorities this holiday season, with exploding cupcakes, disco-ball drones, and a healthy dose of terrorism thrown into the mix. But hey, at least they're trying to keep things festive!</p>
