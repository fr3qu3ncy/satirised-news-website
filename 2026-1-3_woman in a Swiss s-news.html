        <p>BREAKING: Sparkler-Gate Rocks Swiss Ski Resort, Managers Face Criminal Charges<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the managers of Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland have been placed under criminal investigation for their alleged role in a deadly fire that killed 40 people and injured another 119. And we're not talking about just any ordinary sparklers here - no, these were the kind of sparklers that make you go "WHOA, I just ignited my eyebrows!"<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the likely cause of the inferno was the sparklers on champagne bottles being carried too close to the ceiling, which is roughly the same distance as a cat can jump from a speeding bullet. It's like they say: "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But when life gives you sparklers and champagne, make a deadly fire!"<br/><br/>The French couple, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, are suspected of manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence, and arson by negligence - which is just a fancy way of saying they might have been a little too reckless with their sparkler-wielding ways. We're not sure what's more surprising, the fact that they thought it was a good idea to carry sparklers near the ceiling or the fact that nobody called them out on it.<br/><br/>The slow identification process is because of the severity of the burns many of the victims suffered - which is just a nice way of saying people were set ablaze and had to be identified through their dental records. A helpline has been set up for concerned families, but let's be real, if your loved one was incinerated in a bar fire, you're probably not too concerned about anything right now.<br/><br/>In related news, the Italian Civil Protection team is on site, trying to console the victims' families and explaining that yes, it's possible for people to spontaneously combust while trying to take a selfie with sparklers. It's been a tough week for the Swiss ski resort town of Crans-Montana, but hey, at least they can say they've got a unique story to tell - one that involves more fire than a Guy Fieri cooking show!<br/><br/>UPDATE: The bar owners have released a statement saying they'll be implementing new safety measures, including hiring a team of ninja-like fire prevention specialists and installing a giant fan system to prevent sparklers from igniting the ceiling. Sounds like a solid plan to us!</p>
