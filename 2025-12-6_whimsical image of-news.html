        <p>BREAKING: Frank Gehry's Legacy Lives On, But Not in His Laundry<br/><br/>Legendary architect Frank Gehry has left this mortal coil, but his love of jagged angles and industrial materials will live on in the hearts (and laundry baskets) of architecture enthusiasts everywhere.<br/><br/>Gehry, who was 96 when he checked out, was known for his avant-garde style that made people go "huh?" - usually followed by a confused look and a muttered "is that supposed to be art?"<br/><br/>His magnum opus, the Guggenheim Museum in Bilbao, Spain, was like a shiny new TiVo box on steroids. Who needs symmetry when you can have swooping curves and titanium sheets that make you wonder if someone had a few too many margaritas at the design meeting?<br/><br/>But it wasn't just his buildings that made us go "huh?" - it was also his personal style, which included (but wasn't limited to) wearing Hawaiian shirts with leopard-print pants. We mean, who needs a suit and tie when you can wear a neon-colored jumpsuit and call it "fashion"?<br/><br/>Gehry's love of industrial materials also led to some... interesting design choices. Like the time he decided to clad the Walt Disney Concert Hall in Los Angeles in metal that looked like a cross between a sailboat and a broken toaster. Critics called it a "pile of broken crockery," but we just thought it was, you know, art.<br/><br/>And let's not forget his famous "crumpled paper" design inspiration - as seen on an episode of The Simpsons where he voiced himself and designed a concert hall that looked like... well, crumpled paper. Who knew?<br/><br/>In tribute to Gehry's legacy, we've decided to create a new architectural style: "Frank-gehry-ism." It's all about embracing the weird and wonderful, adding a dash of titanium here, some chain-link fencing there, and voilà! You get buildings that are so confusing, people will be talking about them for years to come.<br/><br/>So rest in peace, Frank Gehry - your love of jagged angles and industrial materials will live on forever... or at least until someone comes up with a new architectural style that's even weirder.<br/><br/>In related news:<br/><br/>* The Guggenheim Museum has announced a new exhibit featuring Gehry's laundry basket designs. Admission is free, but you'll need to bring your own detergent.<br/>* Architects around the world are scrambling to come up with their own Frank-gehry-ism-inspired designs - and we're not just talking about buildings. We mean, who needs a boring old garden gnome when you can have one made out of recycled car parts?<br/>* In a bizarre tribute to Gehry's legacy, a group of fans has started selling t-shirts featuring his likeness on the back of a unicorn. Because, why not?</p>
