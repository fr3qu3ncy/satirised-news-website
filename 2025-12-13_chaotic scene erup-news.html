        <p>COMEDY VERSION<br/><br/>Breaking News: Messi's India Tour Turns into Chaos!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Lionel Messi's highly anticipated tour of India turned into a scene straight out of a Bollywood movie... but not the good kind. Thousands of adoring fans gathered at Kolkata's Salt Lake Stadium to catch a glimpse of the football superstar, only to be left disappointed and, well, a bit angry.<br/><br/>Fans Turned Feral<br/><br/>As Messi took the stage (or rather, the pitch), he was met with thunderous applause... but not for long. It soon became apparent that the real stars of the show were the local politicians who surrounded him like a bunch of rowdy paparazzi. Who needs Messi when you have Mamata Banerjee, right?<br/><br/>Chaos Erupted<br/><br/>The crowd, which had paid up to 12,000 rupees (that's like a month's salary for some people), grew restless and, well, let's just say they turned into a bunch of Bengaluru Brawlers. Seats were ripped up, banners were torn down, and water bottles were hurled towards the pitch like it was a WWE match.<br/><br/>Shah Rukh Khan's Big Entrance<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bollywood superstar Shah Rukh Khan made a surprise appearance on stage, but not to calm things down. No, he just stood there looking cool as usual while the fans continued to get their Messi-tantrum on.<br/><br/>The Real Hero: Luis Suarez<br/><br/>Messi's teammate and Uruguayan legend Luis Suarez was seen trying to reason with the crowd, but they were having none of it. We guess you could say he got a little too involved in the Messi-mania.<br/><br/>The Investigation: Where's the Accountability?<br/><br/>West Bengal Chief Minister Mamata Banerjee has announced an investigation into the whole debacle, promising to fix responsibility and prevent such occurrences in the future. Yeah, good luck with that.<br/><br/>Messi's Verdict: "I'm Outta Here!"<br/><br/>In a statement released shortly after the chaos erupted, Messi said he fulfilled his time commitment (yeah, right) and left early due to security concerns. Well, at least he didn't get caught up in the mayhem... this time.<br/><br/>Stay Tuned for More Updates!<br/><br/>This is not the end of the story folks. We're sure there'll be more updates on Messi's India tour, including the aftermath of the chaotic event and possibly even a sequel to the Bollywood movie that was the Salt Lake Stadium incident.
