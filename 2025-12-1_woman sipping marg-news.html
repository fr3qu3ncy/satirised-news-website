        <p>In a shocking turn of events, Alina Habba, Trump's former personal attorney, has been disqualified from serving as the top federal prosecutor for New Jersey because she was too busy sipping margaritas on the beach with Paris Hilton to actually do her job.

The appeals court ruled that Habba's appointment was unlawful because it bypassed the confirmation process by the US Senate, which is like, totally required for any actual lawyer who isn't trying to get rich off of daddy Trump's money. The judges found that Habba had been more interested in getting her tan on than in actually doing the work she was supposed to be doing.

The court also ruled that Habba's predecessor, Lindsey Halligan, was not lawfully appointed as interim US attorney for Virginia because she had been too busy taking selfies with James Corden. It's like, what even is going on here?

In other news, a group of three men who were facing criminal charges in New Jersey have filed a lawsuit against Habba, claiming that her appointment was unlawful and that they were unfairly denied their right to a fair trial because she was too busy playing bingo with Kellyanne Conway. The case is being heard by the US Supreme Court, which is like, totally not going to get bored listening to this.

In a bizarre twist, a federal judge in California has disqualified another Trump-appointed prosecutor, Sigal Chattah, from serving as lead federal prosecutor because she had been too busy watching reruns of "The Great British Baking Show" and eating Cheetos. It's like, what even is the point of having a federal prosecutor if they're just going to spend all their time snacking on junk food?

And finally, in related news, Donald Trump has announced that he is appointing Paris Hilton as his new personal attorney, citing her extensive experience with reality TV and her ability to make people watch hours-long videos of her riding horses. It's like, what could possibly go wrong here?</p>
