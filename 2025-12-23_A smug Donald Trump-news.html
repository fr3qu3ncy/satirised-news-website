        <p>It turns out that Donald Trump had a thing for flying on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet and rubbing shoulders with his associates, but he claims it was just for the champagne and good deals, not any involvement in Epstein's sex trafficking schemes.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Private Jet Confessions<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it's been revealed that Donald Trump was not only a frequent flyer on Jeffrey Epstein's private jet, but he also had a "thing" for the disgraced financier's associates. Like, a big thing.<br/><br/>According to a newly released email from an assistant US attorney (aka a super cool government employee), Trump's name pops up at least eight times between 1993 and 1996 as a passenger on Epstein's plane. And get this – he even flew with Ghislaine Maxwell, Epstein's trusty sidekick and all-around bad person.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The email also mentions that Trump was accompanied by some of his most beloved family members, including Marla Maples (his ex-wife), Tiffany (his daughter who's clearly been brainwashed into loving her dad unconditionally), and Eric (his son who's probably just along for the ride).<br/><br/>Now, before you start thinking that Trump was somehow complicit in Epstein's sex trafficking schemes, let's be real – he was just trying to get a good deal on a private jet. I mean, who wouldn't want to fly around with Epstein and his crew, sipping champagne and making poor life choices? It's like the ultimate VIP experience!<br/><br/>But seriously, folks, this is not a joke. The US Department of Justice has released thousands of pages of documents related to Epstein, including some pretty incriminating emails that seem to clear Trump's name. Yeah, right.<br/><br/>In other news, the DOJ has also announced that they're releasing even more files – because who doesn't love a good treasure hunt? – but they're still missing their deadline to publish all the juicy stuff. Sorry, Epstein survivors! Looks like you'll have to wait a little longer for the truth to come out.<br/><br/>And finally, if you're wondering what Trump had to say about this whole ordeal, just remember: he's been saying it since 2020 – "I was never on Epstein's plane." Yeah, sure, Donald. We believe you...</p>
