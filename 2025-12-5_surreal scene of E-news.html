        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Birthright Citizenship Ban Rejected by Supreme Court, but Not Before It Got Weird<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US Supreme Court has rejected Donald Trump's executive order to end birthright citizenship for children born in the United States. But what really happened here is that Trump's lawyers showed up late to court wearing chicken suits and claiming they had "fowl" intentions. It was only after they were asked to leave by a stern-looking justice that the real proceedings began.<br/><br/>As the justices deliberated, a surprise witness emerged: Elmo from Sesame Street. The beloved Muppet took the stand and testified that birthright citizenship is not just for humans, but also for furry friends like him who are born in the US. "Elmo loves America!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump's lawyers tried to argue that the 14th Amendment only applies to people who were born on a Tuesday during a leap year. But their case was soon derailed when they realized they had accidentally brought a piñata instead of actual evidence. It was filled with candy, but also contained a note that read: "You can't fool us!"<br/><br/>In the end, the Supreme Court ruled in favor of birthright citizenship, citing the amendment's clear language and Elmo's testimony as key factors. Trump responded by tweeting, "Sad! Just sad!" followed by a string of angry emojis.<br/><br/>Update: In response to this ruling, a group of rogue llamas has taken up residence outside the Supreme Court building, protesting what they call an "unfair" decision. When asked for comment, one llama simply shrugged and said, "Baaa-d judgment."<br/><br/>Related Story: In other news, the Supreme Court has also ruled that pineapples do not belong on pizza. Justices cited the 14th Amendment's guarantee of individual freedom to make their own topping choices as the reason for this decision. When asked about the ruling, a spokesperson for the pineapple lobby said, "This is a dark day for America."<br/><br/>Stay Tuned: For more updates on this developing story and other news from around the world, keep it locked to our website.
