        <p>RARE SUPERMAN COMIC SPOTTED AT THE BEACH, THEN SOLD FOR $15M<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the rare Action Comics No 1 was found lying on a beach towel at Miami Beach, Florida. Sources close to Nicolas Cage confirmed that he had been using it as a makeshift mat for his sunbathing sessions.<br/><br/>"I'm shocked and saddened by the loss of my beloved Superman comic," said Cage, who purchased the comic in 1996 for a mere $150,000. "I had no idea it was worth so much more than its original price tag - or that I could use it to dry off after a dip in the ocean."<br/><br/>The comic's incredible value was only discovered when a group of teenagers on their summer break stumbled upon it and promptly sold it to an anonymous collector for $15m.<br/><br/>"We were like, 'Dude, this is worth so much money!' and then we just kinda... sold it," said one of the teens. "We figured someone else would appreciate its value more than us."<br/><br/>The buyer, who wishes to remain anonymous, has been identified as a secret society of comic book enthusiasts who have been searching for this particular copy of Action Comics No 1 for years.<br/><br/>"We've been tracking this comic down for decades," said a spokesperson for the group. "And now that we finally have it, we're going to use its value to fund our next intergalactic adventure."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nicolas Cage has announced plans to auction off his remaining comic book collection - which includes a rare copy of Action Comics No 2 and a vintage Spider-Man comic - with proceeds going towards funding a new Nicolas Cage-themed amusement park.<br/><br/>SUPERMAN'S SECRET LAIR FOUND IN NICOLAS CAGE'S BACKYARD<br/><br/>In other news, Superman's secret lair was discovered in the backyard of Nicolas Cage's mansion. The lair, complete with a large "S" symbol and a sign that reads "Superman at Work," has been confirmed to be a real location by multiple sources.<br/><br/>"I just thought it was a really cool garden shed," said Cage. "I had no idea Superman used it as his secret headquarters."<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Superman himself revealed that he has been using the lair to keep an eye on Nicolas Cage's collection of comic books and vintage video games.<br/><br/>"It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it," said Superman. "And besides, I love checking out Nicolas Cage's collection - it's like a time capsule from the 80s."<br/><br/>MEGAN GOOD AND JONATHAN MAJORS JOIN SUPERMAN'S SECRET SOCIETY<br/><br/>Superman's secret society has announced that Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have joined their ranks. The two actors, who are rumored to be starring in a new movie about Guinea's diamond industry, have been spotted attending secret meetings of the society.<br/><br/>"We're thrilled to have Meagan and Jonathan on board," said Superman. "Their expertise in all things African will come in handy when we launch our next intergalactic adventure."<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Meagan Good revealed that she has been studying African dance and Jonathan Majors has been learning how to properly pronounce the name of Guinea's president.<br/><br/>"It's a tough job, but someone's gotta do it," said Meagan. "And besides, I'm just happy to be part of Superman's secret society - it's like being in a real-life superhero movie!"<br/><br/>US MILITARY STRIKES ISLAMIC STATE GROUP TARGETS IN SYRIA... WITH SUPERMAN<br/><br/>In a surprise move, the US military has announced that they will be using Superman as their new top-secret agent to take down ISIS targets in Syria.<br/><br/>"We've been looking for a way to increase our morale and boost recruitment," said a spokesperson for the US military. "And who better to do it than the Man of Steel himself?"<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Superman revealed that he has been training with the US military's special forces unit and is ready to take on whatever challenges come his way.<br/><br/>"I'm not just a superhero - I'm also a highly trained operative," said Superman. "And now, I'm ready to join the fight against terrorism."<br/><br/>COMIC BOOK LOVERS ALERT: NEW NICOLAS CAGE COMEDY SERIES IN THE WORKS<br/><br/>Finally, Nicolas Cage has announced plans to star in a new comedy series about comic book enthusiasts.<br/><br/>"It's going to be a hilarious show," said Cage. "I'll play myself - a lovable but slightly eccentric comic book collector who gets caught up in all sorts of wacky misadventures."<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Superman revealed that he will be making a cameo appearance on the show and has already been spotted practicing his comedy routine with Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors.<br/><br/>"It's going to be a blast," said Superman. "And who knows - maybe we'll even make some cameos as superheroes in disguise."</p>
