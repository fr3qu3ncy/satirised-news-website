        <p>METEOR SIGHTING ROCKS JAPAN: MOUNT FUJI ERUPTS IN... WELL, NOT EXACTLY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Mount Fuji in Japan has erupted - but not with fire and brimstone as you might expect. No, no. This time, it was something far more surprising. A meteor! That's right, folks. A big ol' rock from space decided to make a pit stop over the iconic mountain.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim the meteor was blazing through the night sky like a giant orange Tic Tac in a cosmic vending machine. "I was sipping on a Sake bomb with my buddies when suddenly this huge glowing orb came crashing into view," said Taro Yamada, a local resident. "We were all like, 'Dude, is that a UFO?' And then we realized it was just a rock."<br/><br/>As the meteor hurtled towards Mount Fuji, experts predicted a massive impact that would send shockwaves throughout the region. But in a bizarre twist, the rock simply... bounced off. Like a kid in a bouncy castle, it rebounded with ease, leaving onlookers scratching their heads.<br/><br/>"I've never seen anything like it," said Dr. Emily Chen, a leading astrophysicist at Tokyo University. "It's as if the meteor had a personal trainer who taught it how to dodge and weave around potential impact zones. We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that Mount Fuji is still standing or that the meteor has a secret Instagram account with 10,000 followers."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, local authorities have issued a statement urging citizens to remain calm and carry on as usual. "We understand that this may come as a shock to many of you," said Tokyo Mayor Yuriko Koike. "But rest assured, we're working tirelessly behind the scenes to ensure that our infrastructure is prepared for any eventuality - including, but not limited to, giant space rocks."<br/><br/>In related news, sales of Sake bombs have skyrocketed in the region as residents take advantage of the impromptu meteor-watching party atmosphere.<br/><br/>UPDATES<br/><br/>* A group of enterprising entrepreneurs has launched a new business venture: Meteor Tours. For a small fee, tourists can join guided tours to witness the "Rock from Space" up close.<br/>* The Japanese government has announced plans to build a massive space-rock-sized statue in honor of Mount Fuji's unexpected meteorous encounter.<br/>* A popular meme is circulating online featuring a picture of a confused-looking meteor with the caption: "When you're just trying to get some intergalactic cred, but end up bouncing off Mount Fuji"</p>
