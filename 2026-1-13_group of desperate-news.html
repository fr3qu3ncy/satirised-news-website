        <p>BREAKING: IRAN'S SECURITY OFFICIAL SAYS 2,000 PEOPLE KILLED IN CRACKDOWN ON ANTI-GOVERNMENT PROTESTS, BUT IT TURNS OUT THEY WERE ALL JUST TRYING TO GET TO THE LAST DONUT<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iranian security officials have confirmed that 2,000 people have been killed in the crackdown on anti-government protests. But sources close to the government have revealed that it's not because they were trying to overthrow the regime, but rather because they were all just desperate to get their hands on the last box of donuts.<br/><br/>"It was a classic case of donut-induced hysteria," said an Iranian official, who wished to remain anonymous. "People were willing to risk everything for those sweet, fluffy treats."<br/><br/> Eyewitnesses claim that the protests turned violent when protesters stormed a donut shop in Tehran, leading security forces to open fire on them. But it's believed that many of the casualties were actually caused by the sheer intensity of the desire for donuts.<br/><br/>"It was like a Donut-Eclipse," said one protester, who survived the ordeal with only minor injuries. "We all just lost sight of everything else and focused on getting those donuts."<br/><br/>In related news, the price of donuts has skyrocketed in Iran, with some reports suggesting that they are now being sold for as much as 10,000 Rials (approximately $3 USD) per box.<br/><br/>VIDEO: TRUMP TWEETS SUPPORT FOR IRANIAN GOVERNMENT, BUT IT'S NOT WHAT YOU THINK<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to express his support for the Iranian government's crackdown on anti-government protests. But it turns out that he wasn't actually tweeting about Iran at all.<br/><br/>"I mean, who doesn't love a good donut?" said Trump, in a statement released by his office. "And let me tell you, folks, these Iranian protesters are going to have to fight for those donuts. Believe me."<br/><br/>MADURO'S ARREST NOT WHAT IT SEEMS<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Venezuela, former president Nicolas Maduro was arrested on Tuesday after the US launched a surprise attack on the country. But it's believed that Maduro's arrest may not be what it seems.<br/><br/>Sources close to the government have revealed that Maduro was actually just trying to get out of his marriage to Cilia Flores, and the US used this as an excuse to take him into custody.<br/><br/>"It was a clever move," said one Venezuelan official. "No one suspected a thing until it was too late."<br/><br/>BIDEN SAYS HE'S "ALL FOR DONUTS"<br/><br/>In a surprise move, President Joe Biden has come out in support of the donut industry, saying that he's "all for donuts." But it's unclear what this means for his administration's policy on Iran.<br/><br/>"We're just trying to get everyone to calm down and focus on something more important," said a White House spokesperson. "Like donuts."<br/><br/>UPDATES: EARTHQUAKE HITS MEXICO, BUT IT'S NOT JUST AN EARTHQUAKE<br/><br/>A 6.5 magnitude earthquake hit Mexico City on Tuesday, causing widespread destruction and chaos. But it's believed that the quake may not have been a natural disaster at all.<br/><br/>Sources close to the government have revealed that the quake was actually caused by a group of rogue donut enthusiasts who were trying to get their hands on a rare breed of super-dense donuts.<br/><br/>"It was like a Donut-Eclipse," said one eyewitness. "The ground shook, the buildings crumbled, and people ran for cover."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates as this story continues to unfold!</p>
