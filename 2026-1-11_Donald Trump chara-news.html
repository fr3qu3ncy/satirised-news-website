        <p>US President Donald Trump Orders "Massive" Strikes on Saturday, But Not Against His In-Laws<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump ordered the launch of "large-scale strikes" against Islamic State (IS) group targets in Syria on Saturday. However, sources close to the White House have revealed that the real target was actually the catering team at the White House, who had failed to provide enough donuts for the President's morning meeting.<br/><br/>"We were just trying to get some sugar highs going," said a visibly shaken Trump, "but those IS guys got in the way. Now they're toast."<br/><br/>The strikes, which took place under the codename Operation Hawkeye Strike, involved more than 20 aircraft and over 90 precision munitions. However, eyewitnesses claim that many of these munitions were actually just leftover Christmas presents from Trump's kids.<br/><br/>"It was like a giant game of 'Duck, Duck, Goose' out there," said a stunned US soldier, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, we're trying to fight terrorism and whatnot, but it turns out our main priority is making sure everyone gets their presents on time."<br/><br/>According to sources, the strikes were carried out in an effort to combat terrorism and protect US and partner forces in the region. However, many experts are now questioning whether the real aim was actually just to get rid of the IS group's pesky Instagram accounts.<br/><br/>"We're not saying that these terrorist groups aren't a threat," said a spokesperson for the US Central Command, "but let's be real, their social media presence is just getting out of hand. I mean, who needs 10 million followers when you can have a decent slice of pizza?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth has come under fire for his response to the strikes on X. When asked about the operation, he simply tweeted: "We will never forget, and never relent... to eat all these leftover Christmas cookies."<br/><br/>The Trump administration first announced Operation Hawkeye Strike in December after an IS gunman killed two US soldiers and a US civilian interpreter in an ambush in Palmyra, Syria. However, sources close to the White House claim that this was actually just a cover for a secret mission to get rid of all the leftover holiday decorations.<br/><br/>"It's like that one aunt who just won't take down her Christmas lights," said a source, who wished to remain anonymous. "We just can't have that anymore."<br/><br/>As news of the strikes broke, thousands took to social media to express their outrage and bewilderment. But not everyone was surprised by Trump's actions.<br/><br/>"Honestly, I'm shocked it took this long for him to start bombing someone," said a spokesperson for ISIS, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, we've been trying to get our Instagram accounts verified for years."<br/><br/>In related news, the White House has announced that it will be introducing a new policy of mandatory donut breaks every hour for all staff members.<br/><br/>"It's just part of our commitment to maintaining a healthy and happy work environment," said a spokesperson for the White House. "We can't have our employees getting too stressed out without some good old-fashioned sugar highs."</p>
