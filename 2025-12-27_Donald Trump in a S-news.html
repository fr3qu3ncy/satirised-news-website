        <p>BREAKING: Trump's "Christmas Miracle" Strikes Bring Joy to Nigerians, Confusion to Politicians<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump has revealed that he ordered airstrikes against Islamic State militants in Nigeria as an early Christmas present. Because what's more festive than blowing up bad guys? The strikes were carried out on December 25, despite Nigerian officials claiming it was all just a routine operation with their explicit approval.<br/><br/>"I said to my team, 'Hey, let's give them a Christmas present,'" Trump explained in an interview with Politico. "And I'm pretty sure they didn't think that was coming, but we hit them hard. Every camp got decimated." One can only imagine the looks on the militants' faces when they saw Santa's sleigh descending upon their bases.<br/><br/>The Nigerian government has been fighting various jihadist groups for years, but it seems Trump's team thought it would be a great idea to give them an extra-special surprise this holiday season. The strikes were reportedly carried out in Sokoto state, where locals claim there was no issue with IS – because they're all just one big happy family.<br/><br/>In related news, the US military has announced that they've been training their drones to do "flybys" during Christmas dinner, and have perfected the art of delivering presents while simultaneously blasting bad guys. It's a festive season miracle!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>As of press time, Nigerian Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar had issued a statement saying that the strikes were planned for quite some time and had nothing to do with a particular religion – except for the fact that Trump just happened to be on the phone with him at exactly 3 PM on Christmas Day, wishing him "Merry Christmas, mate!" The US military has also confirmed that they've started training their troops in the art of doing ninja-style stealth attacks during holiday parties.<br/><br/>In other news, local residents in Jabo village have reported seeing a herd of reindeer fleeing the area after the airstrikes, and eyewitness Umar Jabo claimed he saw something "looking like a plane flash and crash" into fields. Because what's more exciting than planes crashing into fields?<br/><br/>And in a shocking twist, Trump has been seen arguing with his advisors over who gets to keep the leftover Christmas cookies from the White House kitchen. It seems even the most powerful man in the world can't resist a sweet treat.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
