        <p>VENEZUELA'S OPPOSITION LEADER MARÍA CORINA MACHADO GOES INTO HIDING, BUT NOBODY KNOWS WHERE SHE IS (OR DOES THEY?)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuela's opposition leader María Corina Machado has gone into hiding, and the world is left wondering where she could be. Or maybe that's just what they want us to think? After all, she did say she'd return to Venezuela after collecting her Nobel Peace Prize, but then again, who wouldn't want to escape a country with an economy that's as stable as a one-legged stool?<br/><br/>According to sources (okay, it was just a tweet from her account), Machado has been spotted sipping cappuccinos at a trendy café in Oslo, Norway. But don't worry, she's not there for the coffee – she's actually there to prepare for the Nobel Peace Prize ceremony, where she'll be formally awarded the prize for efforts to bring democracy to Venezuela. Or, you know, maybe she just really likes Norwegian cuisine and is using it as an excuse to eat all the waffles.<br/><br/>The Nobel Institute has released a statement saying they're "in the dark" about Machado's whereabouts, but let's be real, they probably just didn't want to reveal that she's actually hiding in a giant novelty hamster ball on top of a secret volcano. After all, who needs actual security measures when you can just use a giant hamster ball?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuela's government has threatened to consider Machado a "fugitive" if she leaves the country – because, you know, being a fugitive is basically the same as being a Nobel Peace Prize winner. They've even accused her of "acts of conspiracy, incitement of hatred, terrorism," which sounds like a pretty standard Monday morning in most countries.<br/><br/>The US has come out in support of Machado, with Secretary Pete Hegseth saying she's a "pillar of democracy" (while simultaneously trying to track down an alleged drug boat – but that's a whole other story). And let's not forget the obligatory cameo by Alfredo Díaz, Venezuela's opposition figure who died in prison and was described as "vile" by the US. Because nothing says "diplomacy" like using words like "vile".<br/><br/>All this drama has left us wondering: where is María Corina Machado really? Is she sipping cappuccinos with a secret agent in Oslo, or hiding in a giant hamster ball on top of a volcano? The world may never know...</p>
