        <p>BREAKING NEWS: Le Pen's Lawyers Show Up to Court with a Case of French Fries and a Whoopee Cushion<br/><br/>PARIS, FRANCE - In a shocking turn of events, Marine Le Pen, the leader of France's far-right National Rally party, took to the stand in an appeal court today, wearing a bright pink shirt and a necklace that read "I'm with Stupid" (referring to her lawyers). When asked about her involvement in embezzling EU funds, Le Pen shrugged and said, "Oh, pffft! That was just a tiny little mistake. We had no sense of having committed an offence... and neither did the European Parliament, apparently."<br/><br/>As she spoke, Le Pen's lawyers were seen sneaking into the courtroom with a tray of French fries and a whoopee cushion, which they promptly sat on, causing a loud fart sound to echo through the room. The judge, visibly annoyed, banged her gavel and shouted, "Order in the court! We are not here to make light of this serious matter... unless you're Marine Le Pen's lawyers, in which case, carry on!"<br/><br/>The appeal, which is expected to last until next summer, centers around charges that Le Pen used European Parliament funding to pay for National Rally staff in France. If the ban is upheld, she will not be able to stand in the 2027 presidential election, a prospect that has sent shockwaves through the French far-right.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside the courtroom, protesters held signs reading "Le Pen's Lawyers Are the Real Culprits" and "French Fries for Justice." When asked about the protests, Le Pen's spokesperson said, "Those people are just jealous of our superior taste in snacks. I mean, who needs justice when you can have a side of fries with your appeal?"<br/><br/>As the trial continues, it remains to be seen whether Le Pen will emerge victorious or if her lawyers' antics will ultimately sink her chances at becoming president.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just hours after the article was published, Marine Le Pen's lawyers were spotted trying to sneak into the courtroom with a tray of escargot. This reporter can neither confirm nor deny that they actually managed to get away with it.</p>
