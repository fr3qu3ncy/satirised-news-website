        <p>BREAKING: Trump's CIA Drone Strike Hits Big Facility, But Where Was Elmo?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump announced that the CIA had carried out a drone strike on a "big facility" linked to alleged Venezuelan drug boats. However, in a bizarre twist, everyone's favorite Muppet, Elmo, was nowhere to be found at the scene.<br/><br/>"I'm telling you, it was a huge explosion," said Trump. "I mean, it was so big that I'm surprised nobody got hurt... except for maybe Cookie Monster, he loves cookies."<br/><br/>Sources close to the matter claim that the facility in question was actually a secret underground lair where a group of narco-terrorists were attempting to load up their boats with a massive shipment of fentanyl. But when asked about the details of the strike, Trump seemed less than forthcoming.<br/><br/>"I don't want to say who did it," said Trump, "but I can tell you that it was definitely not a certain bear from the Muppets... although, come to think of it, he does love honey."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Elmo has been spotted in his favorite spot on Sesame Street, where he's been enjoying a quiet afternoon with Big Bird. When asked about Trump's announcement, Elmo simply shrugged and said "Elmo doesn't know anything about that."<br/><br/>Trump's Press Conference Gets Weird<br/><br/>During the press conference, things took a turn for the absurd when Trump was asked to confirm or deny reports of the CIA's involvement in the drone strike. After a pause, Trump replied: "I'm not saying it was the CIA... but I did just have a delicious plate of nachos from that new Tex-Mex place downtown."<br/><br/>Reporters were left stunned and confused as Trump continued to dodge questions about the CIA's role.<br/><br/>CIA Director Gina Haspel Steals Show<br/><br/>Just when things couldn't get any weirder, CIA Director Gina Haspel suddenly appeared on stage and began dancing the tango with a team of highly trained agents. The crowd was completely mesmerized by the spectacle as Trump looked on in confusion.<br/><br/>"What just happened?" Trump asked his press secretary.<br/><br/>"Don't worry, Mr. President," replied the press secretary. "It's just your typical Tuesday afternoon at the CIA."<br/><br/>Venezuela Accuses US of 'Extortion' Over Oil Tanker Seizure<br/><br/>In related news, Venezuela has accused the US of extorting them over the seizure of one of their oil tankers. When asked for comment, Trump replied: "That's not extortion... that's just good old-fashioned capitalism."<br/><br/>Stay Tuned for More Updates on This Developing Story!<br/><br/>And that's a wrap, folks!
