        <p>BREAKING: Rep Joyce Beatty Sues to Remove Trump's Name from Kennedy Center, Claiming it's a "Living Memorial" to John F. Kennedy's Ego<br/><br/>Washington D.C. - In a shocking move, Rep. Joyce Beatty (D-Ohio) has filed a lawsuit against the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, claiming that renaming it after President Donald Trump is illegal and an affront to the late president's ego.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation, Beatty was so outraged by the name change that she stormed into the meeting where the decision was made, only to be muffled by a group of Trump loyalists wielding earplugs. "It was like they thought I was going to scream, 'Make America Great Again!' all over again," said Beatty in a statement.<br/><br/>The lawsuit claims that Congress intended for the Kennedy Center to be a "living memorial" to John F. Kennedy's impressive comb-over and his ability to eat an entire pizza by himself in one sitting. "It's a travesty, folks," said Beatty. "I mean, have you seen the state of their catering? It's like they're trying to make America hungry again."<br/><br/>In response to the lawsuit, the White House released a statement saying that Trump had "stepped up" and saved the Kennedy Center from financial ruin by securing $257 million in congressional funding for renovations. "And let's be real," said a spokesperson for the president. "Who needs a good name when you can have a great hairdo?"<br/><br/>The renaming of the Kennedy Center has been met with widespread criticism, including from musician Chuck Redd, who cancelled his annual Christmas Eve jazz concert at the center in protest. "I mean, it's like they're trying to put a Trump-themed mullet on the building," said Redd.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Kennedy family is still reeling from the news, with Joe Kennedy III tweeting that "the Kennedy Center is a living memorial to a fallen president and named for President Kennedy by federal law... It can no sooner be renamed than can someone rename the Lincoln Memorial, no matter what anyone says."<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a bizarre twist, it was revealed that the Trump loyalists who voted to rename the center had actually been bribed with free tickets to a Donald Trump impersonator's comedy tour. "It was a deal we couldn't refuse," said one of the loyalists in a statement. "I mean, have you seen his jokes about Hillary Clinton? Priceless."<br/><br/>ALSO: In a shocking revelation, it was discovered that the Kennedy Center's board of trustees currently has 34 members appointed by Trump and 23 others designated as members by US law... and all of them are secretly obsessed with collecting Pokémon cards. "It's just something we do," said one board member in an interview. "We're like a team, man."</p>
