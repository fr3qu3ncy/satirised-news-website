        <p>BREAKING: Schiphol Airport Descends into Chaos as 700 Flights Get Cancelled, and We Blame It All on Pikachu's Revenge<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, more than 700 flights were cancelled at Amsterdam's Schiphol Airport on Wednesday. Sources close to the airport (aka my cousin who works there) confirm that it was not just any ordinary day, but rather a chaotic mess caused by none other than Pikachu, the mischievous Pokémon from our favorite childhood TV show.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Pikachu was spotted in the airport's control tower, frantically pressing buttons and making faces at the air traffic controllers. "We were trying to get people on their way to holiday destinations, but then Pikachu suddenly appeared out of nowhere, shouting 'Pika pika!' and flapping its ears," said an air traffic controller who wished to remain anonymous.<br/><br/>As a result of Pikachu's antics, flights were cancelled left and right, leaving thousands of travelers stuck in limbo. "I was supposed to fly to Paris for my honeymoon, but now I'm stuck here with nothing to do but eat fries and watch the planes taking off without me," said a frustrated passenger, who refused to give his name.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, passengers at Charles de Gaulle airport in Paris were also left stranded due to cancellations. "I was on my way to meet up with Lady Gaga for coffee when suddenly, my flight got cancelled because of Pikachu's revenge," said a bespectacled fan girl who claimed to have met the pop star at a book signing.<br/><br/>Airline staff at Schiphol Airport were seen desperately trying to calm down passengers while juggling their own Pokémon-themed stress balls. "We're doing our best to get everyone on the next flight, but it's like Pikachu has turned into a giant, furry ball of chaos," said Stephan Donker, a spokesperson for KLM.<br/><br/>In related news, the Dutch national airline has reported a shortage of de-icing fluid due to high demand caused by Pikachu's mischief. "We're doing our best to find more de-icing fluid, but it's like finding a needle in a haystack, except the needle is a giant bottle of de-icer and the haystack is Amsterdam," said Donker.<br/><br/>As for Pikachu, its whereabouts remain unknown, but experts warn that it may strike again at any moment. "We're on high alert for any further Pokémon-related incidents," said an airport official who wished to remain nameless.</p>
