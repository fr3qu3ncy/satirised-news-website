        <p>BREAKING: "The Biff" and Family Crash and Burn at Statesville Regional Airport<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former NASCAR driver Greg "The Biff" Biffle and his family were killed in a plane crash at Statesville Regional Airport outside Charlotte, North Carolina. Because, you know, flying is just like racing – except when it's not.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the Cessna C550 aircraft, owned by a private company associated with Biffle, crashed while landing on the east end of the runway. And by "crashed," I mean it went up in flames faster than a McDonald's Quarter Pounder at a Kardashian family reunion.<br/><br/>Congressman Rich Hudson confirmed the tragic news on X, stating that he was "devastated" by the loss of Biffle and his family – including his wife Christina and their kids, Emma and Ryder. Because, let's face it, there's nothing more devastating than losing your favorite NASCAR driver and their spawn in a fiery plane crash.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets worse! The business jet took off just 14 minutes before the crash, which is equivalent to the time it takes for a Kardashian to realize they've made a mistake on social media. And we all know how that turns out – in flames, folks!<br/><br/>Statesville Airport director John Ferguson described the aircraft as a "corporate jet" and said it was already engulfed in flames when he arrived on the scene. Because, you see, corporate jets are just like regular planes, but with more champagne toasts and less likelihood of crashing.<br/><br/>The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) has launched an investigation into the fatal crash, which is code for "we have no idea what happened, but we're going to pretend to investigate anyway." The team expects to arrive on scene Thursday night, just in time for happy hour at the local watering hole.<br/><br/>In related news, NASCAR officials have announced a new safety protocol – all drivers are required to wear fireproof suits and have their families sign a waiver before every race. Because, you know, it's always better to be safe than sorry... or, in this case, dead.<br/><br/>Rest in peace, Greg "The Biff" Biffle and family. May your ashes be scattered over the NASCAR circuit, where they will forever be remembered as the ultimate crash test dummies.</p>
