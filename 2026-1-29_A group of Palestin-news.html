        <p>BREAKING: Israel's Military Has Officially Accepted That They Suck at Math and Have Killed 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza (But Only After They Ran Out of Excuses)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Israeli military has finally admitted that they have killed over 70,000 Palestinians in Gaza during their recent war. We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that they've finally stopped denying it or the fact that they thought we wouldn't notice when they just kept on killing for years.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Israeli military (and by "sources" we mean a 60-year-old man named Moishe who likes to drink coffee at the local café), the number of Palestinians killed in Gaza is indeed over 70,000. However, they've conveniently left out the part where they actually counted them all and made sure to keep track of each and every one.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu simply shrugged and said "meh, numbers are hard." We're not sure what's harder - math or being responsible for genocide (just kidding, it's probably both).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hamas has been celebrating their victory by putting on a big party in Gaza. There were games, food, and even a raffle with prizes like "free housing" and "not getting bombed into oblivion." We're told that the highlight of the evening was when they gave out free burritos to all the attendees.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! According to sources close to the UN (and by "sources" we mean a 30-year-old woman named Karen who likes to eat sushi), the UN has deemed Hamas' numbers as "mostly accurate." We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that they've finally stopped denying it or the fact that they thought we wouldn't notice when they just kept on counting for years.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the UN simply said "yup, that's about right. We've been saying that for weeks." We're not sure what's harder - keeping track of numbers or being responsible for sanctions (just kidding, it's probably both).<br/><br/>In related news, Israel has announced plans to build a new theme park in Gaza called "Gaza World" where visitors can come and experience the thrill of being bombed into oblivion. Tickets are expected to go on sale soon.<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, it turns out that SpongeBob SquarePants has been secretly working as an advisor for Hamas during the war. When asked about his involvement, SpongeBob simply said "whoops?" We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that he got involved or the fact that we never knew he was so good at math (just kidding, it's probably both).<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
