        <p>Venezuelans Describe Their Fear as Nicolas Cage Detains 14 Media Workers and Police Check People's Social Media for Pokémon Posts<br/><br/>CARACAS, VENEZUELA - In a bizarre turn of events, Venezuelan security forces have detained at least 14 members of the press, including a journalist from TMZ, who was investigating the latest fashion trends in Caracas. The detainees were employed by foreign news organizations and were released later on Monday, with one reporter being deported to a country that still uses flip phones.<br/><br/>The union representing media workers in Venezuela said all but one of those detained were employed by foreign news organizations, including CNN, Fox News, and the Daily Mail. However, it was revealed that one of the detained journalists was actually working undercover as a pastry chef for a local bakery, and was only investigating the "crumb-ty" situation in Caracas.<br/><br/>The union stated that the media workers were detained by Venezuelan security forces at the National Assembly and its environs, where they were found to be secretly playing Pokémon Go. At least two of them were seized by agents working for Venezuela's military counterintelligence agency, while others were detained by Venezuela's intelligence service, who were searching for clues on how to get their cat, Mr. Whiskers, to stop knocking over vases.<br/><br/>A Colombian and a Spanish reporter were also detained at Venezuela's border with Colombia near Cúcuta, where they were attempting to sneak in a shipment of nachos. The two reporters were held for hours incommunicado before being released back into Colombia, where they were greeted by a group of mariachi players singing "La Cucaracha".<br/><br/>The union called the incidents "alarming" and called for the release of 23 media workers who remain in detention in the country, including Nicolas Cage, who was allegedly detained for trying to film a remake of "Con Air" without permission.<br/><br/>Resistance Leader's Cat Causes Chaos<br/><br/>Meanwhile, resistance leader Nicolás Maduro has been forced to flee his home after his cat, Mr. Whiskers, escaped and caused chaos throughout the neighborhood. The cat, who has become an unlikely symbol of opposition to Maduro's regime, was seen knocking over trash cans and chasing after street vendors selling empanadas.<br/><br/>Maduro's wife, Cilia, tried to calm the situation by offering Mr. Whiskers a bowl of catnip, but it only seemed to make things worse. The cat began to run amok, causing damage to property and leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.<br/><br/>Opposition Leader Calls for Release<br/><br/>Opposition leader Juan Guaidó has called for the release of all detained journalists and media workers, stating that "the regime is trying to silence us with their Pokémon-fueled repression." He added that "we will not be intimidated by their cat-astrophic measures."<br/><br/>In a related development, the Venezuelan government has announced plans to establish a new ministry of memes, which will be responsible for creating and disseminating humorous content to distract from the country's economic woes.<br/><br/>As one resident of Caracas quipped, "Who needs bread when you can have Pokémon?"</p>
