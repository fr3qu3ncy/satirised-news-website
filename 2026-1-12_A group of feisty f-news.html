        <p>BREAKING: Fed Chiefs Go Wild, Declare War on Trump's Investigation<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, three former heads of the US central bank have taken to the streets, armed with nothing but their sharp wit and an arsenal of dad jokes. Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan, joined by 10 other feisty former officials, have condemned the Justice Department's probe into Fed Chair Jerome Powell as a "coup d'etat" designed to undermine the Federal Reserve's independence.<br/><br/>"It's like trying to put a square peg in a round hole," said Yellen, her voice dripping with sarcasm. "This investigation has no place in the United States, whose greatest strength is its ability to do absolutely nothing about it."<br/><br/>Bernanke chimed in, "We're not just talking about any old probe here. No, no, no. This is a full-blown, Grade-A, extra-large-sized, Trump-authorized investigation... into a guy who's already got a 401(k) that would make your grandma jealous!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Greenspan was overheard muttering something about "monkey business" and " banana republics," but we're not entirely sure what he meant by that.<br/><br/>Powell himself was unavailable for comment, as he was busy practicing his acceptance speech for the "Best Fed Chair Ever" award. When asked about the investigation, he simply shrugged and said, "Hey, I've got a great idea for a Netflix show – 'Fed Up' – where I play the role of a beleaguered central banker trying to navigate a world gone mad!"<br/><br/>As the news spread like wildfire, markets took a brief moment to pause, confused looks on their faces. "Wait, what's going on?" asked one bemused investor. "Is this some kind of joke? Did Trump finally lose his mind and decide to investigate himself?"<br/><br/>Not to be outdone, President Trump tweeted, "Just found out about the investigation into Powell. Sad! He's a total loser, folks. A major numbskull. I mean, who needs an independent Fed when you've got me, the king of all things great and fantastic, in charge?"<br/><br/>The United States Senate was quick to weigh in on the controversy, with Senator Thom Tillis (R-NC) declaring, "I'll be voting against any Fed Board nominee until this whole thing is fully resolved... or until I get a good deal on a new golf cart."<br/><br/>And so, as the dust settles, we're left wondering: will Trump's investigation into Powell ultimately succeed in undermining the Fed's independence? Only time (and a healthy dose of satire) will tell.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, and remember: if it sounds too good (or bad) to be true, it probably is.</p>
