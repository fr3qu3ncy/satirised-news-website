        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela's President Maduro Caught in a Series of Absurd Events, Releases Political Prisoners as a "Goodwill Gesture"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Nicolás Maduro, the President of Venezuela, has been captured by US authorities after a daring raid on his office. But that's not even the most absurd part – it gets better!<br/><br/>As the US was celebrating their victory, they suddenly remembered that they had long demanded the release of political prisoners in Venezuela. And so, in a stunning display of bureaucratic brilliance, Trump tweeted out that he had "given orders" to close the infamous El Helicoide prison, which had become a symbol of Maduro's regime's brutal suppression of dissent.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Trump also announced that he had cancelled a "previously expected second wave of attacks" on Venezuela – because who needs a good attack when you can just release some prisoners and call it a day? It's like the US was trying to win a prize for Most Creative Use of Prison Reforms.<br/><br/>And then, in a move that has left everyone scratching their heads, Trump invited Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader and Nobel Peace Prize winner, to visit him at the White House. She accepted, but not before asking if she could bring her Nobel Prize as a gift – because what's a visit to the US without a good trophy, right?<br/><br/>But let's get back to the real story: Maduro was seized by US authorities after he was spotted trying to escape in a bright pink jumpsuit and a pair of oversized novelty sunglasses. Witnesses claim that he was being chased by a team of highly trained agents who were dressed as superheroes – it's like they raided a comic book convention.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, it's all part of the job, folks."<br/><br/>As for Maduro, he's currently being held in a maximum-security facility where he's being forced to watch an endless loop of Justin Bieber music videos. Sources close to the Venezuelan government claim that Maduro is cooperating with US authorities and has even started taking dance classes – because who needs to be president when you can just bust out some sweet Biebs-inspired moves?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, folks!</p>
