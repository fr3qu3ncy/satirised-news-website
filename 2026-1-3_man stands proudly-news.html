        <p>FIRES RAGE IN DENVER, BUT NO ONE GETS BURNED (UNLESS YOU COUNT THE GUY WHO TRIED TO SELL HIS CAR ON FIRE)<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, a massive fire broke out in Denver on Friday evening. But don't worry, folks! No one was injured... except for the guy who tried to sell his car on fire. Yeah, that's right.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the five-alarm fire, which occurred at an apartment block still under construction, was so intense that it could have easily spread to other nearby homes or businesses. But thanks to the heroic efforts of over 100 firefighters on the scene, the blaze was contained before anyone got hurt... except for that one guy who thought he'd make a quick buck by selling his car as a flaming chariot.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a sci-fi movie," said one firefighter, trying to describe the scene. "But instead of aliens and laser beams, it was just a bunch of people running around with fire extinguishers. Oh wait, and there was also that one guy who tried to sell his car on fire. Yeah, him."<br/><br/>DISNEY EMPLOYEE STRUCK BY RUNAWAY PROP, BUT NO ONE CRIES (BECAUSE IT'S JUST A THING)<br/><br/>In a separate incident, a Disney employee was struck by a giant runaway prop during a live recreation of a scene from the film "Indiana Jones." But don't worry, folks! The employee is okay... except for maybe his ego.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the prop – which appeared to be some sort of giant boulder – suddenly came to life and started chasing after the Disney employee. "It was like something out of a horror movie," said one witness. "But instead of Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, it was just a bunch of foam and wires."<br/><br/>The employee, who wishes to remain anonymous (probably because he's still in therapy), claims that he was simply trying to get into character for the live show when the prop suddenly attacked him.<br/><br/>"I mean, I've seen some weird things in my time at Disney," he said. "But this takes the cake... or should I say, the prop."<br/><br/>CANADIANS OPTIMISTIC ABOUT 2026 (BUT NOT AS OPTIMISTIC AS THE GUY WHO TRIED TO SELL HIS CAR ON FIRE)<br/><br/>As the world enters a new year, people in Canada are looking forward to all sorts of things. From housing and Europe ties to economy and green living, Canadians are hopeful for a better future... except maybe the guy who tried to sell his car on fire.<br/><br/>According to a recent survey, the most popular things that Canadians are optimistic about include:<br/><br/>* Housing: Because who doesn't love a good roof over their head?<br/>* Europe ties: Because nothing says "good relationship" like a bunch of bureaucrats arguing with each other.<br/>* Economy: Because who doesn't love a good recession every now and then?<br/><br/>And, of course, there's the guy who tried to sell his car on fire. Yeah, him.<br/><br/>POLICE RELEASE CCTV FOOTAGE OF BROWN UNIVERSITY SHOOTING SUSPECT (BUT WE CAN'T SHOW IT TO YOU BECAUSE IT'S TOO DISTURBING)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, police have released CCTV footage of the suspect in the Brown University shooting. But don't worry, folks! We can't show it to you because it's too disturbing.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the footage shows the suspect – who looks suspiciously like your average college student – walking calmly through the campus while students run around screaming and crying.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a horror movie," said one witness. "But instead of Jason Voorhees or Freddy Krueger, it was just a bunch of kids with smartphones."<br/><br/>The footage has been censored for your protection... or because we don't want to get sued by the families of the victims.<br/><br/>SIX INJURED AS HOUSE EXPLODES IN CALIFORNIA (BUT IT'S NOT LIKE ANYTHING OUT OF THE ORDINARY)<br/><br/>In a shocking incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, six people were injured when a house exploded in California. But don't worry, folks! It's not like anything out of the ordinary.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the explosion was caused by a natural gas line leak... or maybe it was just because someone lit a match and forgot about it. Who knows?<br/><br/>The victims are currently receiving treatment at a nearby hospital... where they will undoubtedly be asked if they want to sign up for a timeshare.<br/><br/>And that's the news for today, folks! Stay safe out there (especially if you're thinking of selling your car on fire).</p>
