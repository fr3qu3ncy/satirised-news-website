        <p>BREAKING: THAILAND BOMBS CAMBODIA, AGAIN! (Sort Of)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Thailand decided to drop some bombs on Cambodia's border area... but not just any bombs, folks. These were the "indiscriminate" kind that only Thai Air Force F-16 fighter jets know how to do. And by indiscriminate, we mean they hit everything except for the actual target (which was probably a bunch of cows).<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was just one guy named Bob who was sipping coffee in his pajamas), the bombing campaign was led by none other than Thailand's Prime Minister, Anutin Charnvirakul. Who, coincidentally, was wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and sunglasses when he gave the order. Because, you know, that's exactly what you want to do during a war - look cool while dropping bombs.<br/><br/>CAMBODIA FUMES, THAILAND BRAGS<br/><br/>The Cambodian government (aka King Norodom Sihamoni's hairdresser) was not pleased with Thailand's actions. They called it an "indiscriminate attack" and claimed several civilians were injured (not to mention the poor cows). But Thailand just shrugged it off, saying they hit their target... mostly.<br/><br/>"We did our best to avoid hitting anything important," said a Thai Air Force spokesperson. "By 'important,' I mean we didn't hit any actual buildings or people... this time."<br/><br/>WILLY WONKA JOINS THE BATTLE<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Willy Wonka himself showed up on the battlefield, sporting his signature top hat and cane. What he was doing there is anyone's guess (maybe he just wanted to get in on some of that sweet, sweet chocolate bar money from selling war supplies), but sources close to him say he's now offering a "War Chocolate" flavor: it's like his classic Wonka Bar, but with an extra kick... of patriotism.<br/><br/>THE US AND CHINA TRY TO MEDIATE (Sort Of)<br/><br/>The United States and China have been trying to help negotiate a ceasefire between Thailand and Cambodia. But not really. They're just there for the free snacks at the border checkpoint. "Hey, who doesn't love a good snack?" said an anonymous source.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS<br/><br/>So there you have it: Thailand bombs Cambodia (again), Cambodia gets mad, Thailand shrugs, Willy Wonka shows up, and the US and China are just happy to be there for the free food. It's all just another day in Southeast Asia, folks!</p>
