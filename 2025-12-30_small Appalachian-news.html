        <p>BREAKING: Controversy Reigns as Two Christian Nationalist Podcasters Move into Small Tennessee Town<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two self-proclaimed Christian nationalist podcasters have stirred up a hornet's nest in the small Appalachian town of Gainesboro, Tennessee. Andrew Isker and C Jay Engel, hosts of the popular podcast "Contra Mundum", have moved into the Ridgerunner development, a new community built by Josh Abbotoy, a real estate mogul with ties to conservative US circles.<br/><br/>As the town's residents scratched their heads over the sudden arrival of these vocal Christian nationalists, Abbotoy remained eerily calm, stating that concerns about his tenants were "overblown". One can only imagine what kind of shenanigans would ensue when you combine a group of radical podcasters with a bunch of folks who still use flip phones.<br/><br/>"Family Voting" and Mass Deportations<br/><br/>On their podcast, Isker and Engel have been spouting some pretty inflammatory rhetoric. They've called for the repeal of the 20th Century (apparently, it's that pesky decade that introduced things like civil rights and women's suffrage). Oh, and they also want to deport all those "undesirable" immigrants – you know, the ones who are too Indian, South East Asian, Ecuadorian, or African to fit in. Just your average, everyday Christian nationalist stuff.<br/><br/>The Resistance<br/><br/>As news of the podcasters' arrival spread like wildfire through Gainesboro, a group of locals decided to take matters into their own hands. They formed an informal resistance movement, complete with signs reading "You Belong Here" and "Don't Eat Somewhere Else If You're an Oppressor". When Abbotoy's boys tried to hold a meeting at the local fast food joint, dozens of townsfolk showed up to give them a piece of their minds.<br/><br/>The Verdict<br/><br/>It seems that the people of Gainesboro are not having it. As one resident so eloquently put it, "If you promote the inferiority or oppression of others, please eat somewhere else." And just like that, the Christian nationalist podcasters were left with nothing but a bunch of annoyed locals and some unwanted attention from the media.<br/><br/>In related news, a group of Elvis impersonators has been spotted in the area, and experts warn that this could spell disaster for the already-tense situation. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
