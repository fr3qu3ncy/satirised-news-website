        <p>BREAKING: Iran Arrests Marathon Organisers for Allowing Women to Run Without Hijabs...and Other Stuff<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Iranian judiciary has arrested two marathon organisers for allowing women to run without hijabs in a race on Friday. Because, you know, running while unveiled is just not cricket.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, fine, it was just a guy named Bob who happened to be there), about 2,000 women and 3,000 men participated in the marathon separately, with some of the female competitors looking like they just rolled out of bed and put on the first thing they found on the floor. I mean, we're talking messy buns, sweatpants, and a sprinkle of cat hair here.<br/><br/>The Iranian government, however, was not amused. In fact, they were so upset that they decided to arrest the organisers for violating "public decency" (read: not enough hijabs). It's like, what's next? Arresting people for wearing flip-flops in the wrong season?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news, Bridget Phillipson, the Education Secretary and Minister for Women and Equalities (try saying that three times fast), has announced that trans women will not be allowed to attend main Labour Women's Conference events. Because, you know, it's just not a conference without some good old-fashioned exclusion.<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, the Women's Institute has also decided to stop offering membership to trans women. I mean, what's next? Denying them access to the ladies' room?<br/><br/>In related news, Sandie Peggie (who is definitely not a superhero, despite her impressive hairstyle) has launched further legal action against NHS Fife for...well, something or other. Let's just say it involves a lot of paperwork and possibly some cat hair.<br/><br/>Oh, and in case you were wondering, the Iranian government has also paused their new dress code law, which was going to make it mandatory for women to wear hijabs while walking the family dog. Because, you know, nothing says " freedom" like being forced to wear a headscarf while taking Fido out for a stroll.<br/><br/>Finally, in a bizarre twist of events, a young Chechen woman named Aishat fled Russia for a life of freedom (read: not being chased by Russian security agents) but was later found dead in her rented flat. I mean, what's next? Finding out that the cat who killed her was actually an undercover agent?<br/><br/>That's all for now, folks! Stay vigilant and remember to always wear your hijab...just kidding, don't worry about it.</p>
