        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela's Allies Abandon Ship (Literally)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it appears that Russia and China have left Venezuela's Nicolás Maduro high and dry - just like their support for his hairpiece. Sources close to the Venezuelan president confirm that his two main allies have stopped sending free hugs, cheap vodka, and embarrassing dance moves to the beleaguered nation.<br/><br/>"It's a disaster," said Maduro, who was last seen wearing a "I'm with Stupid" t-shirt and pointing at a picture of himself on the wall. "I thought they were my friends. I mean, we've had some wild times together - like that one time we stole all the oil from Ukraine and sold it to China for a nice profit."<br/><br/>Experts say that Venezuela's economic collapse, combined with Maduro's impressive ability to lose elections, has made him less of a priority for both Russia and China.<br/><br/>"Let's face it," said Prof. Fernando Reyes Matta, director of the Centre for China Studies at Andrés Bello University in Chile. "Venezuela is like that one aunt who always shows up late to family gatherings with a plate of stale crackers. Nobody really wants to invite her, but she's just so...there."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has called Maduro to affirm his support - but only after making sure no one was listening in on the conversation.<br/><br/>"Comrade Maduro," said Putin, "I'm not saying I've abandoned you or anything. It's just that our priorities have changed. You know how it is when you're trying to invade Ukraine and simultaneously host a dinner party for oligarchs? Yeah, that's us right now."<br/><br/>In related news, the US has seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, citing "external interference" - or as Maduro calls it, "an act of piracy by those meddling Americans".<br/><br/>"It's all part of their sinister plan to steal our oil and replace me with a younger, more energetic leader," said Maduro, who looks suspiciously like he's been Photoshopped into a picture from the 1990s.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks - Venezuela's allies have abandoned ship, leaving Maduro to fend for himself against the forces of international finance and good taste. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story...or not, because let's be real, nobody really cares about Venezuela anymore.</p>
