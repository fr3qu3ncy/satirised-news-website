        <p>BREAKING: Berlin's Electricity Finally Returns, But Not Before Residents Had to Rely on Pizza Delivery Guys for Power<br/><br/>BERLIN, GERMANY - In a shocking turn of events, the power has been restored to the last homes hit by a five-day blackout in Germany's snow-covered capital, Berlin. And we're not just talking about any old power outage here, folks! No, this was a full-blown, suspected arson attack-caused blackout that left tens of thousands of people without electricity.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The masterminds behind the attack? None other than a far-left militant group called Vulkangruppe - or Volcano Group, for those who don't speak German. And their excuse for targeting the power grid? "We apologise to the less wealthy people in the south-west of Berlin," they said. Yeah, because nothing says "apology" like targeting the most vulnerable citizens.<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "What's the big deal? It's just a little blackout." Well, let me tell you, this was no ordinary blackout! This was a marathon - 5 days to be exact - of candle-lit dinners, flashlights as lamps, and pizza delivery guys who doubled as personal electricians. That's right, folks, in the absence of power, the pizza delivery guys became the de facto authorities, delivering not only food but also vital information on when the power would return.<br/><br/>And then there was Reinhold, a 79-year-old retired architect who claimed to have been born in post-war Germany and therefore knew all about hardship. "I was born in 1947," he said. "When my mother and I came from the hospital... it was -20C in our shack." Okay, sure, Reinhold, but that's no excuse for not having a working thermostat.<br/><br/>As for Vulkangruppe, they're being investigated by federal prosecutors as a terrorist organisation, with possible charges including membership in a terrorist organisation, sabotage, arson, and disruption of public services. But hey, who needs actual power when you can have a good old-fashioned game of "spot the saboteur"?<br/><br/>In related news, the US has offered Ukraine "strong" security guarantees, but let's be real, folks, it's not like they've ever kept their promises before (see: Greenland, 2025). And speaking of Ukraine, did you know that their President Volodymyr Zelenskiy and US Special Envoy Steve Witkoff have a love-hate relationship with Jared Kushner? Yeah, it's complicated.<br/><br/>Anyway, back to Berlin. So, the power is on again, but let this be a warning to all you would-be saboteurs out there: we may not have the best internet speeds or coffee culture, but we've got pizza delivery guys who'll get the job done!</p>
