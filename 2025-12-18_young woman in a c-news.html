        <p>A former HR executive's life was turned upside down after a viral video of her embracing her boss at a Coldplay concert led to abusive messages, death threats, and an awkward interview with Whoopi Goldberg.</p>

        <p>HR EXEC IN VIRAL COLDPLAY CLIP SPEAKS OF ABUSE, THREATS AND TRYING TO FIND A NEW JOB (BUT NOT BEFORE BARELY SURVIVING AN INTERVIEW WITH WHOOPI GOLDBERG)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former HR executive Kristin Cabot has come forward to reveal the horrors she faced after being caught on camera embracing her boss at a Coldplay concert. The viral video, which showed Ms Cabot and her then-boss Andy Byron awkwardly swaying to music before trying to hide from the camera, was watched millions of times and became the butt of many jokes.<br/><br/>But for Ms Cabot, the ordeal was only just beginning. "I was bombarded with abusive and threatening messages," she said in an interview. "Women were the cruellest critics - I mean, who needs that kind of negativity in their life?"<br/><br/>Ms Cabot revealed that she received death threats, had her private details put online (yes, doxxing is still a thing), and was subjected to up to 600 calls a day from angry strangers. Her kids were too embarrassed to be picked up from school or go to sports games with her, and the paparazzi outside her house was like a "parade" (she actually used that word).<br/><br/>But it wasn't all doom and gloom for Ms Cabot - she did manage to secure an interview with Whoopi Goldberg. In a cringe-worthy clip, Ms Cabot can be seen sweating profusely as she tries to answer Whoopi's probing questions about the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Andy Byron has been keeping a low profile since his resignation from Astronomer, the tech company he used to run. His fake statement, complete with Coldplay lyrics, went viral after the concert and had to be followed up with an actual statement from the company.<br/><br/>THE FUNNIEST PART?<br/><br/>It turns out that Ms Cabot has been trying to find a new job, but has been told she's "unemployable". Yeah, good luck with that. Maybe she should try applying at the local comedy club - they could always use another victim... er, employee.<br/><br/>And in related news, Gwyneth Paltrow has announced her latest promotional video for Astronomer, featuring a tongue-in-cheek clip of her doing some sort of weird dance moves while laughing maniacally. Because, you know, that's exactly what people want to see when they're trying to recover from a public scandal.<br/><br/>THE FUTURE LOOKS BRIGHT?<br/><br/>After weeks of therapy for her kids and a few rounds of tennis to get her back on track, Ms Cabot is starting to feel like herself again. "I'm not sure what the future holds," she said in an interview, "but I'm hoping it won't involve any more viral videos or death threats."<br/><br/>And as for Mr Byron? Well, let's just say he's been keeping a very low profile since his resignation. Maybe he should try applying at the local comedy club too - they could always use another... oh wait, never mind.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
