        <p>Breaking News: Brazil's Bolsonaro Still Can't Stop Hiccuping, Wife Blames Weekend Party<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, former Brazilian president Jair Bolsonaro has undergone his third medical procedure in four days to treat his persistent hiccups. And it seems like the only thing that's getting treatment is his diaphragm – while his ego and dignity are still hiccuping.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation, Bolsonaro's wife Michelle said that her husband's hiccups "had not stopped' since the weekend – which was probably when he got a little too excited at that party in Rio. I mean, who doesn't love a good samba and some spicy wings?<br/><br/>Doctors say they've performed two successful operations on Bolsonaro's right and left phrenic nerves, but it seems like his hiccups are still winning the battle. And we can't help but wonder – was this whole ordeal just an excuse to get out of attending the World Cup? I mean, who needs a functioning diaphragm when you've got a great excuse for missing the game?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bolsonaro's medical team is still trying to figure out why his hiccups won't quit. And we're guessing it has nothing to do with the fact that he's serving a 27-year sentence and can't stop thinking about how much he loves being in charge.<br/><br/>In related news, Brazil's Supreme Court has allowed Bolsonaro to be transferred from police headquarters where he is serving his sentence to... well, somewhere else. We're not quite sure what's going on there, but it sounds like a real mystery novel.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just got word that Michelle Bolsonaro is now on Twitter, saying "my husband's hiccups are getting worse by the minute" and asking for donations to help pay for his medical bills. We're guessing this means she's planning on opening up her own YouTube channel and monetizing her husband's misery.<br/><br/>Also: It seems like Bolsonaro's son Flávio is still trying to run against current president Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2026 presidential election – despite his dad being, you know, busy with some hiccups. We're guessing this means he'll be running on a platform of "I'm not as bad as my dad" or something.<br/><br/>And finally: If you're looking for a good laugh, just imagine Bolsonaro trying to give a speech with hiccups – it's like watching a toddler try to eat spaghetti while wearing a tutu.</p>
