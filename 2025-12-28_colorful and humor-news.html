        <p>The Frog Takes Over: A Comedy News Article<br/><br/>HEADLINE: "Frogs in Space Suits Unite Against Trump Administration, Because Why Not?"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, frogs have become the unlikely symbol of resistance against the Trump administration. It all started when a man in a frog suit faced off with immigration enforcement agents in Portland, Oregon, and the internet just lost it.<br/><br/>"I mean, who wouldn't want to see a grown man in a bright green frog onesie getting pepper-sprayed by a bunch of angry immigration agents?" said local resident, Jane Doe. "It's like they say: 'When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. And when life gives you a frog suit, get sprayed with mace and post about it on Instagram'!"<br/><br/>But seriously, folks, the frog has become a powerful symbol of resistance against the Trump administration. And why not? I mean, who needs actual policy change or meaningful reform when you can just wear a funny costume and make fun of the President?<br/><br/>PEPE 2.0: THE RISE OF THE LEFT-WING FROG<br/><br/>The left-wing frog movement has taken off in recent weeks, with protesters donning inflatable frog costumes and unicorns at demonstrations across the country. It's like they say: "When in doubt, add a unicorn."<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what's more impressive," said Prof. LM Bogad, "the fact that people are using frogs as a symbol of resistance or the fact that we're still living in a world where someone thought it was a good idea to wear a frog suit to a protest against immigration enforcement agents."<br/><br/>And then there's the infamous Pepe, the right-wing cartoon character who was once used to signal certain emotions (read: "I'm a racist and I don't care"). But now, thanks to the left-wing frog movement, Pepe has been rebranded as a symbol of resistance.<br/><br/>"It's like they say," said Matt Furie, the creator of Pepe, "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. And when life gives you a cartoon character that was once used by Nazis, turn him into a left-wing frog and sell t-shirts."<br/><br/>THE FROG SUIT: A NEW FRONTIER IN PROTESTING<br/><br/>The frog suit has become a staple of protests against the Trump administration, with protesters donning the getup to make fun of immigration enforcement agents.<br/><br/>"I mean, who needs actual policy change when you can just wear a funny costume and make fun of the President?" said local resident, John Smith. "It's like they say: 'When in doubt, add a frog suit'."<br/><br/>And then there's the added bonus of getting pepper-sprayed by immigration agents while wearing the suit.<br/><br/>"It's like a rite of passage," said protester, Jane Doe. "If you haven't been pepper-sprayed at least once while wearing a frog suit, are you even protesting?"<br/><br/>THE FUTURE OF PROTESTING: FROGS IN SPACE SUITS<br/><br/>As the left-wing frog movement continues to gain momentum, one thing is clear: the future of protesting has never looked brighter (or more ridiculous).<br/><br/>"I mean, who needs actual policy change when you can just wear a funny costume and make fun of the President?" said Prof. LM Bogad. "It's like they say: 'When in doubt, add a frog suit and some space marines'."<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. The frog has taken over, and we couldn't be happier (or more confused).</p>
