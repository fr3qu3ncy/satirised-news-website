        <p>Iran's hanging chad-dogs are at it again, executing over 1,500 people since December, which is basically just a vague time period when you're trying to kill lots of people.</p>

        <p>EXECUTIONS GALORE! IRAN'S HANGING CHADDOGS ARE AT IT AGAIN!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Iran Human Rights (IHR) group has verified that at least 1,500 executions have taken place in Iran since December... or was it January? Wait, no one's really sure because time is like, totally irrelevant when you're trying to execute people. According to sources close to the IHR group, which is not a thing, but let's just go with it, the number of executions has more than doubled compared to 2024.<br/><br/>Now, we all know that Iran loves its capital punishment almost as much as it loves its mediocre wrestling. But this time, it seems like they've really gone all out – or should I say, all in? The government's been so busy executing people left and right that they've had to hire a team of professional line-dancers to perform the Macarena at every execution to, you know, "distract" everyone from the whole death thing.<br/><br/>And who can forget the mastermind behind this operation – none other than Mahsa Amini's hijab (yes, her scarf was actually in charge)? It's like, totally not responsible for the mass demonstrations that broke out across the country in 2022, but let's just say it played a huge role. I mean, who needs a scapegoat when you can blame a piece of cloth?<br/><br/>But seriously, folks, this surge in executions has got everyone from UN experts to the Kardashians (okay, maybe not them specifically) talking. It seems like every time Iran feels threatened, they just go ahead and execute more people to, ahem, "forestall internal opposition." Yeah, because that's exactly what happens when you kill a bunch of people – it keeps others from getting all riled up.<br/><br/>Now, if you'll excuse me, I have some important business to attend to. Like checking my Instagram for the latest cat videos and whatnot.</p>
