        <p>Breaking News:<br/><br/>"Trump Threatens Venezuela, Again! (And Other Stuff)"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has announced that the United States will keep or sell the oil it's "borrowed" from Venezuela - because, why not? I mean, who needs to pay for things when you're a billionaire and a president?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (aka my grandma), Trump was seen wearing a navy suit with a bright red tie while addressing reporters in Florida. When asked about the oil seizures, he replied, "We'll keep it, maybe sell it, or use it for our Strategic Reserves... you know, like when I stock up on Cheetos."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nicolás Maduro, the President of Venezuela (and also a great guy, apparently), has responded to Trump's threats by saying, "Hey, dude, focus on your own country's issues. We've got oil to sell and people to feed... not necessarily in that order." <br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The US military has seized three oil tankers this month (because who needs regulations, anyway?), including one on Saturday, which was apparently carrying a "dark fleet" of oil - like, the kind they use in pirate movies. <br/><br/>And if you thought that was enough, Trump also announced plans to strike targets on land because, as he put it, "We don't want our people poisoned... by what? I mean, who knows?" . This comes after the US military has carried out deadly strikes on alleged Venezuelan drug-smuggling boats (because who doesn't love a good conspiracy theory?). Around 100 people have been killed in these operations, but hey, that's just a minor detail.<br/><br/>In other news, Jeffrey Epstein and Donald Trump were spotted together in a photo from 2002 - just to remind you all of the many scandals surrounding Trump. And Ben Sasse, a former US Senator, has announced he's got stage-four pancreatic cancer... which is totally unrelated to his previous claims that Trump was "a death sentence" for the country.<br/><br/>Finally, an Irish citizen named Donna Hughes-Brown has been released from immigration detention in Kentucky after her husband appealed to Congress - because who doesn't love a good family drama?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story (just kidding, it's just another day in the Trump presidency).</p>
