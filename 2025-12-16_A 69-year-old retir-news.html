        <p>BREAKING: Boris Gurman, 69, Charged Straight Towards Danger, Grabbed Gun and... Tried to Call His Wife's Mom for Lunch<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, retired mechanic Boris Gurman, 69, was involved in a daring showdown with an alleged attacker at Bondi Beach on Sunday. According to eyewitnesses, Mr. Gurman "charged straight towards the danger" and grabbed one of the gunman's guns, a witness said.<br/><br/>"I couldn't believe my eyes," said Ahmed al Ahmed, 43, another bystander who was hailed as a hero for disarming one of the attackers earlier in the week. "Boris just walked up to that guy and said, 'Hey, mate, give me that gun!' I thought he was crazy, but then he started wrestling with him like it was a barroom brawl. Next thing you know, they're both on the ground, and Boris is trying to call his wife's mom for lunch."<br/><br/> Witnesses reported that Mr. Gurman's bravery was not without consequence. "He got shot, of course," said one witness. "But before he went down, he managed to grab the phone and shout 'Mum! Tell Sofia I'm running late!' I guess that's what they mean by 'going out with a bang'."<br/><br/>The attack, which has been described as a terrorist incident targeting the Jewish community, resulted in the deaths of at least 15 people, including Mr. Gurman and his wife Sofia.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Couple's Family Speaks Out<br/><br/>In a statement released on Tuesday, Mr. Gurman's family said they were "heartbroken" by the loss of their loved ones, but also "proud" of Boris's bravery. "We can't believe he tried to wrestle that gun away from the guy," said Sofia's mom, who was still trying to process the events of Sunday. "I mean, I'm proud of him, but now I've got a bunch of bills to pay for therapy because my daughter is traumatized."<br/><br/>VIDEO: Dashcam Footage Shows Couple Trying to Stop Gunman<br/><br/>In the dramatic dashcam footage released by the BBC, Mr. Gurman can be seen wrestling with one of the alleged attackers and trying to take his gun away. Witnesses reported that he then got up, hit the attacker with the gun, and shouted "Oi, mate! You're going down!"<br/><br/>According to Reuters, the woman who owns the dashcam footage described Mr. Gurman as a hero. "I was driving home from the gym when I saw this old bloke getting into a bar fight," she said. "The next thing I know, he's charging straight towards the danger and taking the guy down. It was like something out of an action movie."<br/><br/>PHILIPPINES CONNECTION: Suspects Trained in South East Asia<br/><br/>According to Australian media reports, the alleged attackers, Sajid and Naveed Akram, received "military-style training" while in the Philippines on November 1. However, Philippine military officials have said that there is no confirmed evidence of this.<br/><br/>"I was just having a nice cup of coffee when I heard about it," said a Filipino cafe owner who wished to remain anonymous. "But now my business has plummeted because people are scared to go out after dark."<br/><br/>WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT THE BONDI BEACH HANUKKAH SHOOTING<br/><br/>In a series of confusing updates, police have confirmed that the attack was carried out by Sajid and Naveed Akram. Authorities also found "homemade" IS group flags and improvised explosive devices in their vehicle.<br/><br/>"We're still trying to figure out what happened," said a police spokesperson who wished to remain anonymous. "But one thing's for sure – we're going to have to get some new training manuals because it seems like everyone involved was some kind of expert in martial arts."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
