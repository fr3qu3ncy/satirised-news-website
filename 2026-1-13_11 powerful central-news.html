        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>11 Central Banks Join Forces to Tell Trump to Stop Being a Jerk<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, 11 central banks from around the world have come together to tell US President Donald Trump to stop his incessant bullying of Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell. Because, you know, it's not like the Fed is just a bunch of bankers playing with numbers and rates, but actually trying to keep the economy from totally imploding.<br/><br/>The statement, signed by the likes of Christine Lagarde (European Central Bank), Andrew Bailey (Bank of England), and Michele Bullock (Reserve Bank of Australia), reads: "Chair Powell has served with integrity, focused on his mandate, and an unwavering commitment to not being a Twitter tantrum-thrower. We stand in solidarity with him against the injustices perpetrated by President Trump's administration."<br/><br/>The move comes after the US Department of Justice launched a criminal investigation into Powell's alleged misuse of Fed funds for "renovating his office" (apparently, this is a thing now). The investigation has been condemned by former Fed Chairs Janet Yellen, Ben Bernanke, and Alan Greenspan, who are basically like, "Uh, no, dude, this isn't how it works."<br/><br/>Trump, in response to the central banks' statement, tweeted: "Fake news! The Fed is corrupt! Powell is a loser!" (par for the course, really).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Powell himself has been taking hits on Twitter from a certain someone who shall remain nameless (@realDonaldTrump), but he's refusing to back down. "This is about whether the Fed will be able to continue to set interest rates based on evidence and economic conditions, or whether instead monetary policy will be directed by political pressure or intimidation," Powell said in a statement.<br/><br/>The investigation has been likened to something out of a bad 80s action movie: "We're watching you, Powell! You're going down for these 'crimes'!"<br/><br/>As one Twitter user quipped: "Who knew the Fed was actually a secret society of superheroes fighting against Trump's evil plans? #FedSavesTheDay"<br/><br/>In related news, we've just learned that the Bank of England has secretly been training a team of ninja accountants to take down any rogue accountants who might be working for the Trump administration.<br/><br/>Breaking Update<br/><br/>Just in, reports are coming in that North Carolina Senator Thom Tillis has vowed to oppose the nomination of Powell's successor until the investigation is "fully resolved." We're pretty sure this means he'll just keep tweeting angry things at the Fed until it all blows over.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
