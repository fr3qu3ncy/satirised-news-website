        <p>BREAKING: Christmas Miracle Turns into Tragedy as Hikers Find Themselves Lost in Greece with Only a Drone and a 50s-style Dance Hall Soundtrack<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, four hikers - three men and a woman - went missing on Christmas Day while attempting to reach the summit of Korakas peak in central Greece. However, things took a strange turn when they stumbled upon an abandoned disco dance hall at an altitude of 2,000m (6,561ft).<br/><br/>"It was like stepping into a time warp," said one of the hikers, who wished to remain anonymous. "We thought we were lost forever, but then we heard 'I Will Survive' blasting from within the dance hall and knew we had found our Christmas miracle."<br/><br/>Unfortunately, their joy was short-lived as they soon discovered that an avalanche had swept them away, burying them under a thick layer of snow.<br/><br/>"We tried to do the cha cha slide, but it was no match for Mother Nature," said another hiker. "The only thing we could think of doing was singing 'Jingle Bells' with our arms flailing in the air."<br/><br/>A large-scale search operation was launched, and authorities finally found the group's bodies partially covered by snow on a steep and inaccessible slope near the summit.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a horror movie," said Vasilis Vathrakogiannis, a spokesperson for the Hellenic Fire Service. "The hikers were wearing bright orange jumpsuits with flashing lights on them. We thought they were part of a human-sized Christmas tree."<br/><br/>Rescue officials said the group's drone, which had been controlling an unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV), was still flying around the area when it crashed into a nearby pine tree.<br/><br/>"It was like the drone was trying to get away from the scene," said Haris Asariotakis, head of the Hellenic Rescue Team mission. "We found a note attached to its leg that read 'If you're reading this, I'm still stuck in Greece'."<br/><br/>The recovery operation is ongoing, with authorities using a helicopter and a winch system to retrieve the bodies.<br/><br/>"This is a sobering reminder that even in the most unexpected places, tragedy can strike," said the spokesperson for the Hellenic Fire Service. "And also, if you ever find yourself lost in Greece with only a drone as your companion, make sure to bring a disco dance hall sound system."<br/><br/>In related news, a group of hikers in England have started a petition to make Christmas Day a national holiday for hiking enthusiasts.<br/><br/>"We just want one day off from our hike-a-thon," said a spokesperson for the group. "And maybe some disco music would be nice too."</p>
