        <h2>RUSSIA'S DEFENSE MINISTRY SHOOTS DOWN 77 DRONES... WHILE STRIKING UKRAINE! Wait, what?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Russia's defense ministry claimed to have shot down 77 Ukrainian drones while simultaneously launching strikes on the city of Kremenchuk, because who needs logic when there's war involved?</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Putin's Russian Strike Squad Gets Fierce Review from Kremenchuk Mayor<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left the world wondering if they've entered an alternate reality, Russia carried out strikes on the Ukrainian city of Kremenchuk while its defense ministry said it had shot down 77 Ukrainian drones in several locations. Yes, you read that right – 77 drones! It's like someone from the Avengers just landed in Ukraine with a bunch of high-tech gizmos.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (aka the Mayor of Kremenchuk), Vitaliy Maletsk, who's probably still trying to process what happened, said his city was "hit by a massive combined strike" on its infrastructure. You know, the kind that makes you go, "Hold my coffee and watch this!"<br/><br/>Now, we're not sure how these Russian strikes manage to avoid all the drone-destroying missiles they claim to have shot down, but hey, who needs logic when there's war involved?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukraine President Volodymyr Zelensky was probably busy negotiating with Donald Trump's team over some peace talks in Florida. Yeah, good luck with that – maybe he should've brought a drone or two along for the ride! Anyway, Zelensky said on Saturday that he had a "very constructive" call with the Trump squad and that they discussed how to keep Russia from breaking any potential peace deal. It's like they're trying to out-peace each other!<br/><br/>And did we mention France President Emmanuel Macron got involved too? He offered his full solidarity (which is French for "I'm all in") to Ukraine, promising to work with everyone to secure some de-escalation measures and impose a ceasefire. We guess that means he's going to use his superpowers to make Russia just... chill.<br/><br/>But wait – it gets even better! UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer (yes, the one who was probably sipping tea while watching all this unfold) is set to meet Macron, Zelensky, and German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in London on Monday. Imagine them gathered around a table like some sort of "peace summit" – it's almost as if they're trying to negotiate the price of a bunch of drone parts!<br/><br/>In conclusion (or not), Russia's defense ministry claimed they shot down 77 Ukrainian drones while Ukraine got hit by Russian strikes, and now everyone's just confused. It's like someone threw a big ol' plate of spaghetti at a wall and said, "Hey, let's make some peace!"</p>
