        <p>BREAKING: US Coast Guard Pursues Third Oil Tanker Linked to Venezuela<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left everyone scratching their heads, the US Coast Guard is currently in "active pursuit" of an oil tanker linked to Venezuela. The tanker, identified as Bella 1, was allegedly flying a false flag and under a judicial seizure order.<br/><br/>But here's the twist: Bella 1 was being piloted by none other than Danny DeVito, who was spotted wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and a "I'm with Stupid" t-shirt. When asked for comment, DeVito simply shrugged and said, "Hey, I'm just trying to make a living here."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the US authorities have already seized two oil tankers this month - one of them on Saturday. The Trump administration has accused Venezuela of using oil money to fund drug-related crime, while Venezuela has described the tanker seizures as "piracy." And by piracy, they meant actual pirates, like Captain Jack Sparrow, who was spotted swabbing the decks and muttering something about " Arrr, matey."<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better. The Bella 1 was allegedly carrying oil from Iran to Venezuela, but not just any oil - it was a special shipment of artisanal coffee beans that were supposed to be used for medicinal purposes only.<br/><br/>As the pursuit continues, one can't help but wonder if this is all just a giant game of "Tankeropoly" between the US and Venezuela. After all, who needs actual diplomacy when you have oil tankers and false flags?<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>China has just released a statement denouncing the "unilateral and illegal sanctions that lack a basis in international law or authorisation by the United Nations Security Council." But little do they know, it's actually just a ploy to distract from their latest attempt at invading Hong Kong with an army of disco-dancing pandas.<br/><br/>And Russia? Well, they're just happy to see Danny DeVito getting his 15 minutes of fame. After all, who needs actual military intervention when you have the power of memes?<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
