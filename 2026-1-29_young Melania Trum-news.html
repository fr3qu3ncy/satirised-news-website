        <p>BREAKING: Melania Trump Documentary Not Showing in South African Cinemas, Because Who Needs Truth and Freedom When You've Got a Good White Genocide Lie?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the highly anticipated documentary about US First Lady Melania Trump has been banned from showing in South Africa. And by "shocking," we mean totally predictable, given the country's recent history with President Trump's questionable policies.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the film industry (i.e., our intern who works at a cinema), Filmfinity, the distributor of the documentary, decided not to release it due to "recent developments" and the "current climate." Yeah, we're sure that has nothing to do with Trump's love for white genocide conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>As part of its promotion campaign, Melania Trump herself rang the opening bell of the New York stock exchange on Wednesday, because who needs a decent education system when you've got a fancy title and a husband with a bad comb-over?<br/><br/>The film, which follows Melania in the 20 days leading up to her husband's second inauguration (because that's exactly what we all want to see – more Trump), has been met with widespread excitement among Americans, mainly because they're still trying to figure out why their country elected a guy who wears a hairpiece and tweets about it.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Amazon paid a whopping $35m (£25m) to market the film, which is roughly the same amount of money the entire South African economy makes in a year. You know, just for context.<br/><br/>Ster Kinekor and Nu Metro, the two main cinema chains in South Africa, have conveniently forgotten to list showtimes for Melania on their websites, because why bother with facts when you've got a good excuse to ignore them?<br/><br/>As tensions between the US and South Africa continue to rise, it's clear that someone needs to remind President Trump that there's a thing called "diplomacy" and that not everything can be solved by tweeting at people.<br/><br/>In related news, thousands of workers in South Africa are still waiting for their American colleagues to sort out trade deals while simultaneously trying to figure out why their government is so keen on hosting war games with China, Iran, and Russia. Priorities, people!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, or as we like to call it – Business As Usual Under Trump.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the independent Labia cinema in Cape Town has been called by Filmfinity and told not to list the documentary. In response, they're planning a midnight screening of The Matrix, because who needs truth when you've got Morpheus?</p>
