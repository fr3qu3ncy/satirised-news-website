        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>RUSSIAN ARCHAEOLOGIST ARRESTED FOR ILLEGAL EXCAVATION OF ANCIENT CITY... AND ALSO FOR BEING A TERRIBLE DANCER<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Polish authorities have arrested a prominent Russian academic from the world-famous Hermitage Museum in St Petersburg, who is sought by Ukraine for allegedly conducting illegal excavations and partially destroying the ancient city of Myrmekion in Crimea.<br/><br/>But that's not all, folks! Sources close to the investigation have revealed that the suspect, identified under Polish law as Aleksandr B, was also seen moonwalking down a Warsaw street while singing "I Will Survive" by Gloria Gaynor. When questioned about his dance moves, he reportedly said, "I'm just trying to excavate my way into people's hearts."<br/><br/>The Ukrainian Prosecutor's Office issued an extradition request for Aleksandr B in November, citing evidence of his crimes, which include searching for movable objects on cultural heritage sites without a permit and conducting illegal excavations at the 'Ancient City of Myrmekion' archaeological complex.<br/><br/>But what really raised eyebrows was when it came to light that Aleksandr B had been invited to deliver lectures on Pompeii in Warsaw and several other European cities. It turns out, he used these opportunities to sneak into museums after hours and steal priceless artifacts, which he then sold online as "rare collectibles."<br/><br/>When asked about the allegations, a spokesperson for the Russian embassy in Warsaw simply said, "We're shocked, SHOCKED! That our employee would engage in such nefarious activities. I mean, who needs ancient artifacts when you have a Hermitage Museum ID card?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has weighed in on the situation, saying, "This is a clear case of cultural heritage crimes... and also a really bad haircut. We demand justice for the people of Ukraine!"<br/><br/>The Polish authorities have agreed to remand Aleksandr B in custody at the Warsaw-Białołęka detention centre for 40 days until January 13th while the extradition process goes ahead.<br/><br/>In other news, it's been reported that the suspect's cat, a sleek black feline named "Kerch," has gone into hiding and is currently being sought by Ukrainian authorities.</p>
