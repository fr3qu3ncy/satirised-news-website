        <p>BREAKING: Iranian Currency Hits Record Low, Protesters Demand Better Wi-Fi<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Iranian rial has plummeted to an all-time low against the US dollar, sending shopkeepers in Tehran's Grand Bazaar into a frenzy. But what really has them fired up is not just the economic woes, but also the dreadful internet connection in their shops.<br/><br/>"It's like trying to get a decent cup of coffee while waiting for a 5G signal," said one protester, who wished to remain anonymous. "We need better Wi-Fi to run our businesses, let alone keep up with global events!"<br/><br/>As protests spread across Iran, demonstrators were seen chanting slogans like "Death to bad internet!" and "Long live the Shah (who had better internet)!" Reza Pahlavi, son of the late Shah Mohammad Reza Pahlavi, took to social media to express his support for the protesters, saying, "I'm with you, guys. Victory is ours because our cause is just... and we need faster Wi-Fi!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Masoud Pezeshkian vowed to address the economic issues plaguing Iran, but only after he finishes playing the latest season of Fortnite on his PS5. "We will get to it eventually," he said in a statement. "But first, can someone please fix my router?"<br/><br/>In other news, a group of university students joined the protests, carrying signs that read "Abolish the IRGC (and their terrible Wi-Fi plans)!" The students were reportedly inspired by a viral TikTok video showing a cat trying to use a smartphone with a slow internet connection.<br/><br/>As tensions rise in Iran, world leaders are weighing in on the situation. US President Donald Trump tweeted, "Iran's economy is bust! And their internet is worse!" Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu chimed in, saying, "We're not just fighting for our country; we're also fighting for better Wi-Fi!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates as this story continues to unfold.<br/><br/>Related:<br/><br/>* Iranian Cinema Giant Bahrman Beyzai Dies at 87, Leaves Behind a Legacy of Bad Movie Reviews<br/>* Executions in Iran Estimated to Have Doubled in 2025, Report Says (But Who's Counting?)<br/>* 'Respect the Culture' – FIFA Urged to Allow Pride Match (But Only if They Can Get a Good Wi-Fi Signal)<br/><br/>Follow us for more breaking news and questionable humor: @BBCNews (but only if you have a stable internet connection)</p>
