        <p>**BREAKING: Feta Frenzy! Greece's Sheep Culling Crisis Leaves Country in a Cheese Labyrinth**<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Greece has been forced to cull hundreds of thousands of sheep and goats due to an outbreak of infectious disease. But don't worry, folks, this isn't just any ordinary livestock crisis – it's a full-blown Feta Frenzy!<br/><br/>As the news spread like wildfire (or should I say, like a contagious virus?), the Greek government was left scrambling to contain the situation. "We're not sure what hit us," said a flustered spokesperson for the Ministry of Rural Development and Food. "One minute we were making feta cheese, the next we were culling sheep like they were going out of style."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, farmers across the country are up in arms (or should I say, up in hooves?), complaining that the government's response to the crisis has been as useful as a chocolate teapot. "They've been offering us compensation, but it's like trying to pay for a Mercedes with Monopoly money," said one disgruntled farmer.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! It appears that some enterprising farmers have taken matters into their own hands. Sources close to the matter (okay, I made them up) claim that they've been secretly importing sheep from neighboring countries – including Bulgaria and Turkey – to replace those that were culled. "It's like a game of musical chairs, but with more sheep and less chairs," said an inside source.<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, the crisis has taken an unexpected turn: the Greek government has announced plans to create a National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox – or as I like to call it, "The Feta Fiasco Task Force."<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks, the situation is being kept under control. After all, as one brave sheep farmer put it, "We're not going down without a fight – or at least, a nice plate of feta cheese."<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** In related news, the Greek Stock Exchange has announced plans to introduce a new stock ticker: FETA-GET-AWAY.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story – and remember, when it comes to Greece's sheep culling crisis, you can't make this stuff up!</p>
