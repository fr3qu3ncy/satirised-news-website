        <p>BREAKING: New South Wales Plans to Ban "Globalise the Intifada" Chant, Recalls Parliament to Pass Stricter Hate Speech Laws<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the government of New South Wales has announced plans to ban the infamous phrase "globalise the intifada" as part of a crackdown on "hateful" slogans. Premier Chris Minns, donning his best "I'm with stupid" t-shirt, has called for a Royal Commission into the Bondi shooting, which left 15 people dead and dozens injured.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The premier has also confirmed that he will be seeking to classify the chant as hate speech, because, you know, nobody likes hate. Meanwhile, pro-Palestinian protesters in London were arrested for allegedly shouting "intifada" slogans – probably because they thought it was a fun game of "Simon Says".<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has announced a new gun buyback scheme to purchase surplus, newly banned, and illegal firearms. Because, you know, the best way to deal with violence is to just take away everyone's guns and hope for the best.<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! Australia will be holding a national day of reflection on Sunday, where everyone will light candles in their windows to honour the victims. It'll be like a big ol' candle-lit vigil, except instead of vigils, it'll be just people sitting around with lit candles going "oh, isn't this nice?"<br/><br/>And finally, because we all know what's really important here – cricket! Australia is on the verge of winning an Ashes series, and that's all anyone can talk about. It's like, who needs hate speech laws when you have test cricket?<br/><br/>In related news:<br/><br/>* Bondi beach lifeguards staged a tribute by lining up arm-to-arm facing the ocean, while simultaneously performing a choreographed dance routine to "YMCA".<br/>* The youngest victim of the shooting, Matilda, was remembered at her funeral with a poem that rhymed and everything.<br/>* A group of surfers created a giant circle in the water at Bondi beach yesterday to pay tribute to the victims. They also had a competition to see who could hold their breath the longest while submerged underwater.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
