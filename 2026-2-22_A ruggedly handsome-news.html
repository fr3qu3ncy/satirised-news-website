        <h2>GREENLAND TELLS TRUMP TO TAKE A HIKE! (Literally, No Pizza Delivery Required)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Greenland politely but firmly told Donald Trump to take a hike when he offered to send a hospital ship, saying they already have their own functioning healthcare system that doesn't involve pizza delivery from the President.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>GREENLAND TELLS TRUMP TO "TAKE A HIKE"<br/><br/>In a move that has left the world in stitches, Greenland's Prime Minister Jens-Frederik Nielsen responded to Donald Trump's offer of a free hospital boat by saying, "No thanks, mate. We've got our own healthcare system, and it doesn't involve sending a boat with medical supplies to a bunch of islanders who are 'not being taken care of'."<br/><br/>Trump had announced on social media that he was going to send a US Navy hospital ship, the USNS Mercy, to Greenland because "many people" on the island were sick and not receiving proper medical attention. However, Nielsen shot back by pointing out that Greenland has a public healthcare system where treatment is free for all citizens.<br/><br/>"It's like me sending a pizza to Buckingham Palace because I heard the Queen was feeling a bit peckish," Nielsen joked in an interview. "I mean, we appreciate the thought, but seriously, we've got our own medical professionals and facilities right here on the island."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump's social media post had included a rather... interesting illustration of the USNS Mercy, which looked suspiciously like it was drawn by a kindergartener who had been given one too many lollipops.<br/><br/>When asked about Nielsen's response, Trump's team said they were "disappointed" but not surprised. "Hey, we're used to being rejected by people with better things to do than take our great healthcare offers," said a spokesperson. "But seriously, folks, we really are trying to help the people of Greenland."<br/><br/>In other news, the US Navy has announced that it will be rebranding the USNS Mercy as the "USNS Trump's Taxi" in honor of its new... ahem... "diplomatic mission".</p>
