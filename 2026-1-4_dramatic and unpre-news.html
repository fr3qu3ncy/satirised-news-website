        <p>BREAKING: US Catches President Maduro, Country Descends into Chaos<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro and his wife, citing "drug charges" in New York. The move has sent shockwaves around the world, with leaders condemning the US actions as an "act of armed aggression".<br/><br/>"I'm not surprised," said Chuck Norris, the action hero and martial arts expert. "I mean, have you seen my beard? It's like a force field – unstoppable!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuelan Interior Minister Diosdado Cabello is urging citizens to remain calm, saying "the world needs to speak out about this attack". But not everyone is buying it.<br/><br/>"What's the plan now?" asked Chuck Schumer, Senate Minority Leader. "Maduro's gone, and we're left with a bunch of... well, whatever comes next."<br/><br/>The US has indicated that Cuba could become part of a broader policy in the region, with Trump calling it a "failing nation". But Cuban President Miguel Diaz-Canel is not having it.<br/><br/>"We will not be intimidated by the US," he said. "We'll just make more mojitos and enjoy the crisis."<br/><br/>In related news, the Venezuelan people are taking to the streets – but not in protest. No, they're celebrating Maduro's capture with a huge party.<br/><br/>"The man was like a dictator, always telling us what to do," said one celebrant. "Now we can finally dance to our own beat!"<br/><br/>And then there's the UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer, who refused to be drawn into whether or not the military action may have broken international law. When asked for comment, he simply shrugged and said "I'm just happy to see some stability in Venezuela".<br/><br/>But not everyone is pleased.<br/><br/>"This is a disaster," said a disappointed Boris Johnson. "I was hoping to get in on the ground floor of the next Venezuelan coup – now it's all spoilt."<br/><br/>In other news, the US has announced plans to "run" Venezuela until they can do a safe and peaceful transition. But it seems they've forgotten one thing: they don't have any experience running anything.<br/><br/>"We're great at invading countries," said Marco Rubio, US Secretary of State. "But running them? That's like asking me to cook dinner – I'd burn the house down!"<br/><br/>As for Maduro's wife, she's been indicted on drug charges in New York and is now facing a tough sentence: community service at a local Starbucks.<br/><br/>"It's not all bad," said one lawyer. "She'll get to make some decent coffee and maybe even meet her future husband – the barista."<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems the world has gone mad (in Venezuela), and we're just along for the ride. So sit back, relax, and enjoy the chaos.<br/><br/>Update: Trump has announced plans to invade Brazil next, citing "strong connections" between the two countries' cuisines.</p>
