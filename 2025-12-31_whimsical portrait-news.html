        <p>Heated Rivalry Author Says TV Success Led to Help with Her Parkinson's... and a Few Other Irrelevant Things<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Rachel Reid, author of the hit TV series Heated Rivalry, has revealed that the show's success led her to receive specialist help for her Parkinson's disease. But that's not all - she also got a new pair of slippers, a free donut from Krispy Kreme, and a call from Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson offering to be her personal trainer.<br/><br/>According to Reid, who was diagnosed with Parkinson's in the summer of 2023, a top Parkinson's expert contacted her after hearing about her diagnosis on CNN. The expert, who was sipping on a Starbucks coffee at the time, said he had been searching for Reid everywhere and finally found her by accident.<br/><br/>"I thought it was kind of odd," Reid explained in an interview with Variety, "but then the next day, my cat Mr. Whiskers started speaking to me in French, which really helped me with my writing."<br/><br/>Reid's Parkinson's made it hard for her to write because she could barely control a mouse, let alone type for long periods of time. But thanks to The Rock's expert training, she can now type 50 words per minute while balancing on one leg and reciting the entire script of Heated Rivalry backwards.<br/><br/>Reid also revealed that her appointment with the neurologist was actually a surprise party thrown by her friends, who all dressed up as doctors and pretended to examine her. It was, she said, "the best birthday present ever."<br/><br/>In related news, Reid's book sales have skyrocketed since the TV adaptation hit the screens, and she has been approached by multiple publishers to write about her experiences with Parkinson's... and The Rock.<br/><br/>When asked what advice she would give to aspiring authors, Reid replied, "Make sure you get a good agent, but also invest in a top-notch personal trainer, because trust me, it will change your life."<br/><br/>Heated Rivalry, which follows the story of two ice hockey players who fall in love despite being rivals on and off the ice, is set to launch in the UK on January 10th on Sky and streaming service Now. Don't forget to tune in for the explosive finale, where Shane and Ilya get married by Elvis Presley himself.<br/><br/>In other news, Reid's next book is titled The Adventures of Mr. Whiskers, and it's about a cat who travels through time and space while balancing on one leg and reciting Shakespearean sonnets.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the world of Heated Rivalry, where the lines between reality and TV are blurred beyond recognition!</p>
