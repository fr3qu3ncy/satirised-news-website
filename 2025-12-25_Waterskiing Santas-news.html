        <p>Waterskiing Santas and Giant Cuts of Meat: Christmas Around the World (But Not As You Know It)<br/><br/>In a bizarre celebration of the holiday season, people around the world are engaging in activities that are completely unrelated to Christmas cheer. In London, workers at Smithfield meat market have been throwing giant cuts of meat into crowds of screaming fans, while in the US, skiing Santas have taken to the slopes in Alexandria, Virginia.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Paris, the Notre-Dame Cathedral has been illuminated with bright colors... and a flashing disco ball. Because, why not? It's Christmas, after all! In Nairobi, Kenya, police officers dressed as festive clowns delivered gifts on Christmas Eve, much to the confusion of local residents. And in Lima, Peru, a group of daredevil surfers rode giant waves while dressed as the Three Wise Men.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even weirder! In Bethlehem, held to be the birthplace of Jesus Christ, a group of accountants from Ernst & Young have been reenacting the Nativity scene with a cast of characters including Baby Jesus (played by a lookalike of Gary Lineker), Mary and Joseph (dressed as Victorian-era Brits), and the Three Wise Men (in matching onesies). And in Islamabad, Pakistan, a man has been decorating his Christmas tree with nothing but used socks and old shoes.<br/><br/>In other news, Pope Leo XIV was spotted delivering the traditional Christmas Day Urbi et Orbi speech while riding a unicycle on the main balcony of St Peter's Basilica. When asked for comment, he said, "It's all about spreading joy and cheer... and also getting some exercise." Meanwhile, in the occupied West Bank, two women were seen taking a selfie with the Christmas tree in Nativity Square, but only after they had finished having a heated argument over who got to take the photo.<br/><br/>And finally, in Sri Lanka, girls stood alongside a Christmas nativity scene depicting the birth of Jesus, but all of them were wearing tutus and waving pom-poms. When asked why, one of them said, "We wanted to add a bit of flair to our holiday celebration." Yeah, that's exactly what Jesus would have wanted.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* Waterskiing Santas Take Over Alexandria, Virginia<br/>* Giant Cuts of Meat Thrown into Crowds in London<br/>* Pope Leo XIV Rides Unicycle on Balcony of St Peter's Basilica<br/><br/>Share This Article!<br/><br/>If you liked this article, be sure to share it with your friends and family.
