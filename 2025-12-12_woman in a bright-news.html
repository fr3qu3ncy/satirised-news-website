        <p>BREAKING: Nobel Laureate Narges Mohammadi Arrested in Iran, Supports Say "She Was Taken by Aliens"<br/><br/>LONDON, UK - In a shocking turn of events, Iranian security forces have arrested Nobel Peace Prize winner and women's rights activist Narges Mohammadi, her supporters say. But here's the twist: they claim she was taken by aliens.<br/><br/>Yes, you read that right. According to sources close to the situation (okay, it's just her husband), Ms. Mohammadi was attending a memorial service for a deceased lawyer when suddenly, out of nowhere, a spaceship descended from the sky and beamed her up. "I'm pretty sure she was abducted by aliens," said Taghi Rahmani, her husband. "I mean, have you seen her face? She's got that 'I've been probed' look going on."<br/><br/>The Iranian government has yet to comment on the allegations, but sources within the country's secret space program (yes, that's a thing) claim that Ms. Mohammadi is being held at an extraterrestrial holding facility deep in the heart of Tehran.<br/><br/>Iranian Activist Says Country Threatening Her with 'Physical Elimination' - and Pizza Delivery<br/><br/>Ms. Mohammadi had been a vocal critic of Iran's human rights record, particularly regarding women's rights. In a statement released earlier this year, she accused the Iranian authorities of "intensifying repression since the June ceasefire with Israel." But what really got her in trouble was when she ordered a large pepperoni pizza from Domino's and they added jalapenos without asking.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what I did to deserve such treatment," said Ms. Mohammadi, still recovering from her intergalactic ordeal. "I mean, who doesn't love a good jalapeno on their pizza? It's like they're trying to silence me with spice... and aliens."<br/><br/>Supporters Call for Narges Mohammadi's Release - and a New International Treaty Protecting Humans from Alien Abductions<br/><br/>The Nobel Committee has issued a statement expressing its deep concern over Ms. Mohammadi's disappearance, but not before getting distracted by the prospect of a new international treaty protecting humans from alien abductions.<br/><br/>"We're deeply concerned about Narges' safety," said a committee spokesperson. "But let's be real, if we're going to get involved in intergalactic diplomacy, we need some serious rules on the books. I mean, who's to say what constitutes 'acceptable' use of sonic devices during interrogation?"<br/><br/>In related news, the United Nations has announced plans to draft a new treaty protecting humans from alien abductions - and also from being forced to watch an endless loop of cat videos.<br/><br/>Iranian Activist Sues McDonald's for Serving Her a McRib with No Sauce<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news, Ms. Mohammadi is suing McDonald's for serving her a McRib with no sauce during a recent visit to the Golden Arches.<br/><br/>"I ordered the McRib with extra BBQ sauce," said Ms. Mohammadi, still fuming from her alien encounter. "But what they gave me was a dry, flavorless patty that might as well have been a piece of leather. I mean, who does that? It's like they're trying to silence me with hunger... and aliens."<br/><br/>This is not the first time Ms. Mohammadi has sued McDonald's over a McRib-related issue. In 2022, she successfully sued them for serving her a McRib with an expired bun.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story - and don't forget to tip your waitstaff at the local intergalactic diner.</p>
