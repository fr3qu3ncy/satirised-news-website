        <p>COMEDY VERSION OF THE NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>TO SUCCEED IN OFFICE, MAMDANI WILL NEED TO KEEP HIS SUPPORTERS ENGAGED WITH DAY-TO-DAY GOVERNING... AND NOT GET LAID OFF BY A HOSTILE ADMINISTRATION<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Zohran Mamdani, the newly sworn-in mayor of New York City, has announced that he will attempt to govern without losing his shirt. Experts say it's going to be tough.<br/><br/>Mamdani, who rose to fame with his impressive collection of social media videos, including one where he jumped into the frigid waters of Coney Island in January for a pun on "I'm freezing... your rent", has promised to keep his supporters engaged through day-to-day governing. But will it be enough?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the mayor's office (okay, it was just his cat), Mamdani plans to use social media to educate young voters about how city government works. "Yeah, good luck with that," said a local resident, who wishes to remain anonymous because they're not cool enough.<br/><br/>Mamdani's transition team did not respond to our request for comment, but insiders say he's been seen practicing his "I'm here to help" smile in front of the mirror.<br/><br/>Experts warn that Mamdani will face an uphill battle keeping his supporters engaged, particularly if he doesn't deliver on his promises. "It's like trying to get a teenager to do their homework," said Jane Hall, a communications professor at American University who studies politics and the media. "They'll just roll their eyes and say 'whatever'."<br/><br/>Mamdani's social media strategy has been praised for its creativity and lightheartedness, but some experts warn that it may not be enough to keep his supporters engaged. "It's like trying to put a band-aid on a bullet wound," said Ioana Literat, a Columbia University communications professor who studies youth online political socialisation. "You can't just tweet your way out of every problem."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has been spotted in the background of Mamdani's inauguration ceremony, looking worried that his hair might get messed up by the cold wind.<br/><br/>Mamdani and Trump have reportedly had a few friendly meetings since the election, but insiders say it's all about to go down. "It's like they're trying to keep up with each other's Twitter feuds," said Rutgers Prof Bratich. "But seriously, who needs that kind of drama in their lives?"<br/><br/>As for Mamdani's campaign promises, sources close to the mayor's office (okay, it was just his cat again) say he plans to turn his social media followers into active grassroots organisers. "Yeah, good luck with that," said a local resident, who wishes to remain anonymous because they're not cool enough.<br/><br/>In related news, the New York City Council has announced that they will be offering free yoga classes to all members of Congress in an effort to calm their nerves during tense meetings.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY... OR NOT. WE'LL BE HERE ALL DAY, TRYING TO STAY AWAKE.<br/><br/>WHAT'S NEXT?<br/><br/>* Mamdani's social media followers will likely drop by 50% once they realize he can't actually deliver on his promises.<br/>* Trump will probably tweet something ridiculous about how Mamdani is a "total loser" and that he should just give up now.<br/>* The New York City Council will vote on whether or not to allow Mamdani's cat to join their meetings as an official advisor.<br/><br/>Stay woke, folks!</p>
