        <p>NETFLIX FALLOUT: EX-MISS UNIVERSE CHRISHELL STAUSE GETS INTO IT WITH SELLING SUNSET CO-STAR EMMA HERNAN OVER BOYFRIEND BLAKE DAVIS - AND THE QUEEN OF ENGLAND TAKES A STAND<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former friends Chrishell Stause and Emma Hernan have been at each other's throats on the Netflix reality show Selling Sunset. And it all started because Chrishell just can't stand Emma's boyfriend Blake Davis - the guy who looks suspiciously like Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson in a pair of sweatpants.<br/><br/>Sources close to the show (okay, I made that up) tell me that things got heated between the two friends during an end-of-season reunion. Apparently, Chrishell tried to convince Emma that Blake was a total d-bag, but Emma wouldn't budge - saying she loved him no matter what.<br/><br/>Now, the debate is on: can you still be friends with someone whose partner you dislike? And let me tell you, I have some expertise in this area. I mean, who needs actual advice from relationship experts when you've got the wisdom of a 32-year-old guy living in his mom's basement?<br/><br/>FRIENDS BEWARE<br/><br/>I spoke to Hannah, a woman with first-hand experience of dealing with her friend Georgia and her questionable boyfriend. Apparently, Georgia's fiancé made some pretty...ahem... "suggestive" comments towards Hannah during a night out before the wedding. Yeah, that didn't go well.<br/><br/>According to Hannah, Georgia tried to downplay the whole thing, saying he just liked to flirt with all his female friends. But not just any friends - specifically Hannah. Because, you know, that's totally normal.<br/><br/>RELATIONSHIP EXPERTS WEIGH IN<br/><br/>I reached out to Anna Williamson, a relationship expert and counselor who works on Channel 4's Celebs Go Dating (yeah, I'm basically a celebrity now). She told me that it's super important not to judge or tell your friend what to do when they're dealing with a potentially toxic partner. Unless you can do better, of course.<br/><br/>Anna says you should try to have an open and honest conversation with your friend, but avoid phrases like "I really don't like them" or "I think they're abusive." Just stick to the facts, people! And if all else fails, just tell your friend that you need some space from their partner - because, let's be real, who doesn't love a good excuse to get out of a party?<br/><br/>AND FINALLY<br/><br/>In a shocking twist, Queen Elizabeth II has weighed in on the debate. In an exclusive interview with me (okay, not really), she said: "I think it's all just a bit too much drama for my liking. Can't we all just get along?"<br/><br/>The Queen also revealed that she's been watching Selling Sunset and is totally invested in the saga between Chrishell and Emma. When asked what she thought of Blake Davis, Her Majesty simply shook her head and muttered something about "not wanting to comment on the personal lives of others."<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks - a royal seal of approval (kind of) for my expert advice on how to deal with friends whose partners are just not your cup of tea.</p>
