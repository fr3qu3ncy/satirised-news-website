        <p>Breaking News<br/><br/>HUNDREDS GATHER IN MANAGER SQUARE TO BASK IN THE FESTIVITIES THAT INCLUDED MUSIC, DANCING, AND SANTAS BEARING SWEET TREATS... AND A SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY ELVIS<br/><br/>Bethlehem's Manger Square was transformed into a winter wonderland last night as hundreds of people gathered to celebrate the return of festive festivities in the occupied West Bank. The occasion marked the first time since the Gaza war began that the town had held Christmas celebrations.<br/><br/>Among the revelers were two surprise guests, Elvis Presley and Danny DeVito, who took to the stage to sing a duet of "Blue Suede Shoes." The crowd went wild as the King of Rock 'n' Roll and the King of Comedy performed an impromptu dance routine with a troupe of synchronized Santa Clauses.<br/><br/>"It's about time we brought some joy back to this place," said Bethlehem Mayor Maher Canawati, who was seen high-fiving Elvis between takes. "And what better way to do it than with a little bit of rock 'n' roll and some sweet treats?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the PopeMobile, that iconic vehicle used by the late Pope Francis on his 2014 visit to Bethlehem, made a surprise appearance as a mobile health clinic for Gaza children. The pontiff's former ride was converted into a makeshift medical unit, complete with a sign reading "PopeMobile: Because Who Needs a Halo When You Have a Stethoscope?"<br/><br/>VIDEO EXCLUSIVE<br/><br/>We've obtained an exclusive clip of the PopeMobile in action, where it can be seen dispensing flu shots and handing out candy canes to delighted children. ( Warning: contains footage of Santa Clauses performing an Irish jig with the Mayor of Bethlehem)<br/><br/>In related news, UN Humanitarian Chief Tom Fletcher released a statement expressing concern over the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. "We're not out of the woods yet," he said, while sporting a fetching green jumpsuit and holding a giant novelty mallet. "But with aid trucks arriving and Christmas festivities returning to the West Bank, I suppose it's not all doom and gloom."<br/><br/>The news comes as Israel released 1,968 prisoners and detainees as part of a ceasefire deal with Hamas, including four former hostages who were shown in a video calling their loved ones from inside Gaza. One of them, Alon Ohel, was seen being greeted by a beaming Einav Zangauker, his mother, who had made headlines earlier this week for her tearful video call to her son while he was still captive.<br/><br/>"It's like a miracle," said Mrs. Zangauker, overcome with emotion. "And now, my boy is home, and we can finally start planning that Christmas dinner I've been putting off all year!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>ADDITIONAL REPORTING<br/><br/>* A source close to the negotiations between Israel and Hamas revealed that Elvis Presley's appearance in Bethlehem was a result of a last-minute deal brokered by none other than Donald Trump, who used his legendary negotiating skills to secure the King's participation.<br/>* Meanwhile, the Christmas tree lighting ceremony in Manger Square featured an impromptu performance by Tom Hiddleston, who showed up wearing a festive Santa hat and singing "Jingle Bells" with a backing chorus of reindeer.<br/>* And in other news, we've learned that the PopeMobile has been upgraded to include a state-of-the-art espresso machine, perfect for fueling long hours on the road between humanitarian missions.</p>
