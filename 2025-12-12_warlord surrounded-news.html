        <p>Breaking News: Abu Lulu, the Camels-and-Gold Warlord, Busted by UK<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United Kingdom has accused Al-Fateh Abdullah Idris, aka Abu Lulu, of committing acts of violence against civilians. But what you don't know is that Abu Lulu made his fortune selling camels and gold on eBay before he turned to warlord-ship.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation (aka our mate Dave who lives in Sudan), Abu Lulu was filmed shooting dead at least 10 unarmed captives after the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) seized the city of el-Fasher. Thousands of people are believed to have been killed by the RSF, but don't worry, they're all just "collateral damage" – war speak for "oopsies!"<br/><br/>UK Foreign Secretary Yvette Cooper said, "The atrocities taking place in Sudan are a scar on the conscience of the world, and we will not let it go unpunished... unless there's a great sale at IKEA." She also pledged an additional £21m to provide food, shelter, and health services for civilians impacted by fighting in remote areas. Because, priorities.<br/><br/>The UK has also sanctioned three other RSF commanders, including deputy head Abdul Rahim Hamdan Dagalo, who was shown touring an army base in el-Fasher after the massacre. He's the brother of RSF chief Mohamed "Hemedti" Dagalo, and rumor has it he's got a secret Instagram account where he posts pictures of his cat, Mr. Whiskers.<br/><br/>In related news, the US Treasury Department announced its own set of sanctions against a network of companies and individuals accused of recruiting former Colombian soldiers to fight in Sudan's civil war. It's like they say: "You can't just hire mercenaries from Colombia; you've got to get them through a third-party contract first!"<br/><br/>UPDATE: Abu Lulu has gone into hiding, but sources close to the investigation claim he was last seen sipping coffee at Starbucks, ordering a Venti half-caf, half-decaf iced caramel macchiato with room for cream.</p>
