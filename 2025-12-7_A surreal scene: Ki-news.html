        <p>BREAKING: Kilauea Volcano Erupts, Swallows Camera Whole<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Kilauea volcano in Hawaii has erupted yet again, sending lava flying high into the air and engulfing a camera crew in its wake. The footage is so dramatic that it's been dubbed "Volcano-Gate" by local news outlets.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the camera crew was caught off guard as the volcano suddenly spewed forth molten rock, engulfing them in a sea of ash and flames. "It was like something out of a sci-fi movie," said one witness. "I mean, I've seen some crazy things in my time, but this was just wild."<br/><br/>The camera feed dropped out shortly after the eruption began, leaving viewers stunned and wondering what had happened to the crew. But sources close to the US Geological Survey (USGS) claim that the camera crew is actually safe – they were just temporarily distracted by a sudden appearance of Elvis Presley on set.<br/><br/>"Yes, it's true," said a spokesperson for the USGS. "Elvis dropped in unannounced and started singing 'Hound Dog' while riding a unicycle on top of the volcano. We're not entirely sure why he was there or what he wanted, but we're just happy that our camera crew is safe."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the volcanic eruption has been described as "spectacular" by local residents, who claim it's been causing chaos in the area. "I mean, I've seen some crazy stuff in my time, like the time the chicken nuggets ran amok at the county fair," said one resident. "But this is just something else."<br/><br/>The USGS has assured residents that the eruption is under control and that there's no need to panic – unless you're Elvis Presley, in which case you should probably stick around for a few more minutes.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, the White House has announced that they've invited Elvis to perform at the annual "Volcano-Gate" gala, where he'll be joined by special guest stars Michael Jackson and Lady Gaga. Don't miss it!<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES AS THIS STORY CONTINUES TO UNFOLD<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>(Note: The following article contains a series of completely unrelated news stories)<br/><br/>BREAKING: Truck Hits Overhead Sign on Ohio Highway<br/><br/>In an shocking turn of events, a truck has collided with an overhead sign on I-70 in Columbus, Ohio. Witnesses claim that the driver was attempting to do donuts in the middle of the highway when he lost control and hit the sign.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a video game," said one witness. "I mean, I've seen some crazy stuff in my time, but this was just wild."<br/><br/>The driver is currently being treated for minor injuries at the scene.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, officials have announced that they'll be installing a new sign on the highway that reads "Please don't crash into us" – a clear reference to the recent truck incident.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>BREAKING: NASA ASTRONAUT FILMS NORTHERN LIGHTS FROM SPACE<br/><br/>In an astonishing turn of events, NASA astronaut Zena Cardman has captured footage of the Northern Lights from space. The video shows the breathtaking display of colorful lights dancing across the curvature of the Earth.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a science fiction movie," said Cardman in a statement. "I mean, I've seen some crazy stuff in my time, but this was just wild."<br/><br/>The footage has been hailed as one of the most spectacular displays of the Northern Lights ever captured on camera.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, officials have announced that they'll be installing a new feature on NASA's website – a "Volcano-Gate" tab where users can view live footage of erupting volcanoes and occasionally Elvis Presley riding a unicycle on top of them.</p>
