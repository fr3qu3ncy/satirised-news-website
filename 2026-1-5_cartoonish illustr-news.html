        <p>BREAKING: CHAOS ERUPTS IN SWISS SKI RESORT AS BARTENDERS CAUSE HAVOC WITH SPARKLERS<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, 40 people were killed and 116 injured in a bar fire at the popular Crans-Montana ski resort on New Year's Eve. But it wasn't just any ordinary bar fire – oh no. It was a catastrophe caused by the most unlikely of culprits: two French bartenders with a penchant for sparklers.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the bartenders were seen carrying champagne bottles with sparklers attached to them, which they then proceeded to wave around like a pair of drunken accountants at an accounting convention. "It was like they were trying to set off a fireworks display in a confined space," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous but whose eyes still looked haunted by the memory.<br/><br/>As the sparklers danced and flickered, the acoustic foam on the ceiling suddenly turned into a giant fire-breathing dragon, engulfing the entire bar in flames. It was like something out of a bad sci-fi movie.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get to the bar to order another drink when I saw the sparklers," said local resident Pierre Dupont. "Next thing I know, the whole place is on fire and people are running around like headless chickens."<br/><br/>The investigation has revealed that the bartenders, who have been named as Jacques and François, had a history of being a bit...unconventional in their approach to bartending. "They were always experimenting with new drinks and techniques," said a colleague. "But I never thought they'd try to set off a firework display inside a bar."<br/><br/>As for the sparklers, it seems they were just trying to add a little extra something to the New Year's Eve celebrations. "We were trying to create a festive atmosphere," said Jacques in a statement. "I guess we took it a bit too far."<br/><br/>The police have launched a criminal investigation into the incident and are still trying to figure out how two bartenders managed to cause so much chaos.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Swiss authorities have announced that they will be implementing new safety regulations at all bars, including a ban on sparklers, glitter, and any other item that might be considered remotely flammable. They have also vowed to crack down on any bartenders who try to sneak in their own "special effects" during future events.<br/><br/>FURTHER UPDATE: The families of the victims have announced plans to hold a candlelit vigil outside the bar where the incident occurred, but with one catch: they've asked that everyone wear funny hats and bring a spare set of sparklers for good luck.</p>
