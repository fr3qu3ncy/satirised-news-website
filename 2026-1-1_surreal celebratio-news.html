        <p>BREAKING: Zohran Mamdani Sworn in as First Muslim Mayor of New York City... in a Subway Station with a Quran, a T-Rex, and a K-Pop Performance<br/><br/>In a bizarre ceremony that left onlookers scratching their heads, Democratic politician Zohran Mamdani was sworn in as the first Muslim Mayor of New York City. But here's the twist - it didn't happen in the usual civic hall or town square. Nope! Mamdani took his oath over a Quran in the disused Old City Hall subway station.<br/><br/>As he placed his hand on the sacred text, a T-Rex suddenly appeared out of nowhere and started doing backflips while reciting Shakespearean sonnets. Yes, you read that right - a T-Rex with a love for Elizabethan drama! The crowd went wild as Mamdani's wife, artist Rama Duwaji, handed him the Quran while balancing on one foot.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Just as Mamdani was about to finish his oath, K-Pop sensation BTS suddenly appeared on the scene, performing an impromptu dance routine to their hit single "Boy With Luv". The crowd went absolutely bonkers, with some people crying tears of joy and others just plain confused.<br/><br/>"I'm honored to be sworn in as the first Muslim Mayor of New York City," Mamdani said, trying his best to maintain a straight face. "And I'm especially grateful for the T-Rex's Shakespearean skills - it really brought me back to my high school days!"<br/><br/>As for the T-Rex, it just shrugged and said, "Hey, someone's gotta bring some excitement to this town hall stuff!"<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>* The subway station has been closed indefinitely due to "unforeseen circumstances" involving a giant hamster wheel.<br/>* K-Pop fans are already planning their next protest outside City Hall, demanding more BTS performances at official government events.<br/>* Rama Duwaji's artwork has skyrocketed in value, with collectors clamoring for her unique style of Quran-balancing on one foot.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
