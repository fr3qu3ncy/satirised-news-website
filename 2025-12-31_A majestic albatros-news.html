        <p>BREAKING: Albatrosses in Serious Threat of Being Caught and Killed by Fishing Boat Nets, World Leaders React with "Meh"<br/><br/>CAPE TOWN, SOUTH AFRICA - In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that albatrosses are being caught and killed by fishing boat nets at an alarming rate. The usually stoic world leaders have responded to this crisis with a collective shrug and a "meh".<br/><br/>According to sources, the birds are getting tangled in the cables and dragged under, resulting in their untimely demise. "It's like they're trying to get caught on purpose," said Tim Appleton, a British conservationist who has been studying these majestic creatures.<br/><br/>The situation is being handled by the Albatross Task Force, a team of highly trained bird-watchers who are working tirelessly to prevent further tragedies. Led by Andrea Angel, the team has been using innovative methods such as bird-scaring lines - essentially nautical scarecrows that deter the birds from getting caught in the nets.<br/><br/>However, things have taken a turn for the absurd when it was revealed that the bird-scaring lines are being made by disabled workers from the Ocean View Association for Persons with Disabilities. "It's like they're trying to make us feel bad about ourselves," said a world leader, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, who needs dignity when you can have a decent bird-scaring line?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Popeye the Sailor Man has offered his services to help combat this crisis. "I yam what I yam, and that's a sailor with a heart of gold," said Popeye. "I'll go out there and... (flexes arm) ... save those albatrosses in no time!"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to spiral out of control, world leaders have been seen taking selfies with the albatrosses, which has only added to the absurdity of it all.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The United Nations has issued a statement saying that they are "aware" of the situation and will be releasing a report on it... eventually.</p>
