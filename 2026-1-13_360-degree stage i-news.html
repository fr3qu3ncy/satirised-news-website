        <p>BREAKING: BTS Announces Mammoth Comeback Tour, Promises to Make $1bn and Break the Internet<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, K-pop sensations BTS have announced a 79-date world tour, because who needs personal space or a social life when you can dance in high heels and sing about your feelings? The tour will take the septet across Asia, Europe, and America, with dates in London, Tokyo, Munich, Sydney, and Los Angeles. Because, why not?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the band (aka their manager's LinkedIn profile), BTS are expected to make a whopping $1bn from their reunion - that's roughly 740 million pounds or 4 billion Korean won. We're sure it'll be a great investment, considering they've already spent millions on those matching yellow suits.<br/><br/>The tour will feature a 360-degree, in-the-round stage, which is just what the world needs: more people crammed into small spaces to watch seven guys sing about their feelings. It's like a Korean version of the Spice Girls reunion, but with more dance moves and less Scary Spice's awful fashion choices.<br/><br/>BTS's comeback concert will be held at Goyang Stadium in South Korea on April 9, 2026, because who needs Easter Sunday when you can watch seven guys sing in high heels? The European leg includes dates in Paris, Madrid, Brussels, and Munich - just what the continent needed: more K-pop.<br/><br/>When asked about the tour's success, a BTS representative (aka Jimin's cousin) said, "We're thrilled to announce our comeback tour. It's going to be huge... just like our egos." When pressed for further comment, they added, "We've already sold out 50% of the tickets to our fans' moms, so it's a done deal."<br/><br/>BTS's solo projects have kept hardcore fans invested, mainly because they're still trying to figure out what a "solo project" means. Weverse crashed when the band announced their comeback, and we can only assume that was due to the sheer excitement of fans trying to get tickets.<br/><br/>The album, which has yet to receive a title (because who needs titles when you have BTS?), will be released on March 20th. When asked about the progress, RM said it had been "weird" adjusting to life outside the military, mainly because they're still trying to figure out what a "personal life" means.<br/><br/>In related news, Taylor Swift's Eras Tour and Oasis's reunion tour have officially been cancelled in favor of BTS's comeback concert. When asked about this development, a Taylor Swift spokesperson said, "We were always going to cancel our tour, because who needs that when you can watch seven guys sing in high heels?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on the BTS comeback tour, and try not to get too excited... unless you're part of ARMY, in which case, go ahead and freak out like a crazy person.<br/><br/>Tour Dates:<br/><br/>* Goyang Stadium (South Korea) - April 9-11<br/>* Tokyo Dome (Japan) - May 14-16<br/>* Paris, France - June 18-19<br/>* London, England - July 6-7<br/>* Sydney, Australia - August 10-12<br/>* Los Angeles, USA - September 15-17<br/><br/>Tickets:<br/><br/>* Go ahead and try to buy them. We're not getting any.<br/>* Prices range from $50 to $1,000, depending on how much you love BTS.<br/>* Don't worry if you can't afford it; just watch the tour videos on YouTube and pretend you were there.<br/><br/>New Album:<br/><br/>* Release date: March 20th<br/>* Title: TBD (because who needs titles when you have BTS?)<br/>* Expect more songs about their feelings, dance moves, and high heels.</p>
