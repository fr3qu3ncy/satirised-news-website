        <p>BREAKING: Putin and Trump's Envy Get It On in Moscow, As Ukraine Tries to Keep Up<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin is set to meet with US special envoy Steve Witkoff (yes, that Steve) at the Kremlin, after the White House said it was "very optimistic" about reaching a deal to end the Ukraine war. But wait, there's more! US President Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner will also be joining the party, because who doesn't love a good diplomatic summit with a side of nepotism?<br/><br/>The talks come after two days of negotiations in Florida between Ukrainian and US officials, including Witkoff and Kushner, aimed at refining a US-backed peace plan that had been viewed as favorable to Russia. Because, you know, Russia loves being the favorite.<br/><br/>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky described the talks as "constructive", but said there were "some tough issues that still have to be worked through". Translation: Ukraine is trying not to get too excited, while also trying not to get invaded by Russia. Good luck with that!<br/><br/>Witkoff's meeting with Putin will be during the second half of Tuesday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Meanwhile, Putin was filmed visiting a command post at the weekend, because who doesn't love a good photo op? In the video, he's quoted as saying Russia had made progress in "an important area, we all understand just how important". Important like, say, their ego?<br/><br/>The summit comes hours after Russian officials claimed to have captured the key strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine. But let's be real, folks, if it's not on Instagram, did it even happen? Ukrainian officials made no acknowledgement that either city had fallen to Russia, and open-source intelligence projects monitoring the front lines of the war suggested neither Vovchansk nor Pokrovsk had yet been fully captured by the Russian army. But hey, who needs facts when you have a good story?<br/><br/>The talks also come after the release of the initial US-Russia draft peace plan, which sparked consternation in Kyiv and around Europe. As well as being heavily slanted towards Moscow's demands, it also dictated how several billion in frozen Russian assets currently held in European financial institutions should be invested, as well as setting the terms for Ukrainian market access in Europe. Because, you know, Russia loves a good bailout.<br/><br/>Speaking on Monday, Macron said there was currently "no finalised peace plan to speak of", and insisted that any such proposal could only be worked out with input from Ukraine and Europe. But let's be real, folks, who needs input when you have Putin and Trump's Envy getting it on?<br/><br/>The question of territorial concessions could "only be finalised by President Zelensky", but we all know what really matters: the fate of the frozen Russian assets. Because, as we all know, money makes the world go round.<br/><br/>Update: We've just received word that Steve Witkoff will also be wearing a suit to the summit, because who doesn't love a good power-dressing moment?</p>
