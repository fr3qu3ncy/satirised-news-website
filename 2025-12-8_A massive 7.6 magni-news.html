        <p>COMEDY EDITION<br/><br/>Magnitude 7.6 Earthquake Strikes Japan, Because Why Not?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a massive magnitude 7.6 earthquake hit the north-eastern coast of Japan. Because, why not? It's not like they have enough to deal with already. The quake occurred at 23:15 (14:15 GMT) at a depth of 50km (31 miles), which is just perfect for causing maximum chaos and destruction.<br/><br/>The Japanese government, being the pros that they are, immediately issued orders for about 90,000 residents to evacuate their homes. That's right, folks, it's like a giant game of musical chairs, but instead of chairs, it's houses. And instead of music, it's the sound of buildings crumbling and people running around like headless chickens.<br/><br/>Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi took to the airwaves to address the citizens affected by the earthquake. Her message was simple: "Reconfirm your daily earthquake preparedness, such as ensuring that you secure furniture, and prepare to evacuate immediately if you feel shaking." In other words, "Hey, Japan! Just another Tuesday for you, right?"<br/><br/>The government has set up a response office within the prime minister's crisis management centre, because what's an emergency without a fancy-sounding name? And, of course, they've convened an emergency team to assess the damage and implement emergency disaster response measures. Because who needs a social life when there are earthquakes to deal with?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, some bullet train services have been suspended along the north-eastern coast, which is just great for all you commuters out there who were looking forward to getting to work on time. And don't even get me started on the tourists who are now stuck in Japan with nothing to do but enjoy the scenery... and the occasional earthquake.<br/><br/>In related news, the Higashidori and Onagawa nuclear power plants have reported no irregularities as a result of the quake. Because, you know, that's always a good sign when it comes to nuclear power plants. And just to put everyone's minds at ease, the Japanese authorities have assured us that there are no signs of radiation leaks... yet.<br/><br/>So, if you're planning on visiting Japan anytime soon, don't worry – I'm sure the earthquakes will only add to your travel experience. Just remember to pack your sense of humor and a good pair of running shoes.<br/><br/>Related News<br/><br/>* India Actor Dileep Cleared in 2017 Rape and Abduction Case: Because who needs justice when you can just clear someone's name?<br/>* Thousands Flee Thai-Cambodia Border After Deadly Clashes: And why not add some international drama to the mix?<br/>* No Christmas Homecomming: Families Mourn Victims of Goa Nightclub Fire: Just another day in Japan – where life is always a party, and death is just a minor setback.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story... or not.</p>
