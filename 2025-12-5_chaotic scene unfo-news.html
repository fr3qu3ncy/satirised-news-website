        <p>NETFLIX TAKES OVER WARNER BROS, BUT NOT BEFORE THEY GET STUCK IN A TIME LOOP AND HAVE TO DEAL WITH PLETHORA OF UNEXPECTED PROBLEMS<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Netflix has agreed to buy the film and streaming businesses of Warner Bros Discovery for $72bn (£54bn), but things took a strange turn when they discovered that Warner Bros' offices were actually a portal to a parallel universe.<br/><br/>As employees of both companies attempted to close the deal, they found themselves stuck in a never-ending loop, reliving the same day over and over again. It wasn't until they stumbled upon a hidden room containing a VHS tape labeled "How to Negotiate a Deal without Losing Your Mind" that they were able to break free from the time loop.<br/><br/>However, their troubles weren't over yet. As they attempted to finalize the deal, they realized that Warner Bros' CEO was actually a cyborg created by Elon Musk's secret robot army.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Netflix co-chief executive Ted Sarandos tried to reassure shareholders that the acquisition would be a huge success, but things quickly took a turn for the worse when he accidentally superglued his shoes to the conference table.<br/><br/>"We're highly confident that we'll receive the regulatory approval we need," he said, trying to hide his sticky situation. "And by combining the library of Warner Bros shows and movies with our series such as Stranger Things, 'we can give audiences more of what they love and help define the next century of storytelling.'"<br/><br/>But things got really weird when David Zaslav, president and chief executive of Warner Bros, burst into the meeting wearing a full Batman costume and shouting "I am vengeance, I am the night, I am Netflix's worst nightmare!"<br/><br/>As tensions rose between the two companies, they realized that their combined streaming service would be called "Netflix Warner Bros Max," which sounded suspiciously like the name of a new theme park ride.<br/><br/>"I don't think this is going to end well," said Danni Hewson, head of financial analysis at AJ Bell. "I mean, have you seen the lines for that new Harry Potter ride at Universal Studios? This deal is going to be like trying to fit 5000 people into a single elevator car on New Year's Eve."<br/><br/>And as the dust settled, it was revealed that Warner Bros' iconic water tower logo had been secretly replaced with a giant image of a Netflix DVD player.<br/><br/>"It's not just a merger," said Paolo Pescatore, founder and technology media and telecom analyst at PP Foresight. "It's a full-blown takeover by the overlords from planet Netflix-6. Resistance is futile."<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>We've been informed that Netflix has since filed for bankruptcy due to an unforeseen surge in demand for VHS tapes of old movies, while Warner Bros' CEO has been forced into hiding after being pursued by a team of rogue accountants.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
