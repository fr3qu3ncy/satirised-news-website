        <p>BREAKING: Danish PM Tells Trump to Stop "Threats" Against Greenland, Warns Him Not to Try Any "Harry Potter" Magic<br/><br/>COPENHAGEN, DENMARK - In a bold move, Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has told Donald Trump to stop his "threats" against Greenland and warned him not to try any "magical" attempts to annex the tiny Arctic island nation. Sources close to the government revealed that Frederiksen was seen sipping on a strong cup of coffee while delivering her stern warning, saying "You know what they say, Mr. Trump: 'You can't have your cake and eat it too' - or in this case, you can't annex Greenland and still expect us to let you keep your golf course membership!"<br/><br/>As the world waits with bated breath for Trump's next move, insiders claim that he has been seen pacing around the Oval Office, muttering something about "Greenland being like the ultimate prize in Monopoly" and how "he really needs it to complete his collection of miniature flags." Meanwhile, Greenland's Prime Minister, Múte Bourup Egede, was spotted practicing his defensive strategy on a beachside volleyball court, shouting "We're not for sale, Mr. Trump! We're like the in-laws you can't get rid of - we're stubborn and will make your life miserable if you try to annex us!"<br/><br/>In related news, sources close to the White House revealed that Trump has been secretly practicing his Greenland-themed stand-up comedy routine, which includes jokes about how "Greenland is so cold, even the icicles are depressed" and "Why did the polar bear go to Greenland? To get away from all the Danish people!" However, advisors quickly squashed the idea, saying "Uh, no, Mr. Trump. That's not funny at all. Just stick to making fun of your own haircuts."<br/><br/>As tensions rise between Denmark and the US, Frederiksen was seen conferring with world leaders over a plate of smørrebrød sandwiches, discussing possible alliances and military strategies to defend Greenland against any potential American invasion. Meanwhile, Trump has been spotted huddled in a dark corner of the Oval Office, whispering something about "using his best 'I'm-a-big-boy-now' face" to try and intimidate the Danish government into backing down.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story - and remember: if you're ever in Greenland, just tell everyone you're there to take a scenic boat tour of the fjords... and not because you heard it's actually a giant ice cube that you can use as a makeshift Frisbee!</p>
