        <p>GOA NIGHTCLUB FIRE: PANIC IN THE ARABIAN SEA (NOT EXACTLY)<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left the world in stitches, 25 people were killed and several others injured in a night club fire in Goa, India. The fire, which was caused by indoor fireworks (because who needs safety protocols when you can have pyrotechnics?), broke out at the popular Birch nightclub in the bustling nightlife area of Baga.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses described the scene as "horrific" – not because of the death toll or injuries, but because they had to wait in line for 10 minutes to get into the club and then were denied entry due to a dress code that included no shorts. One eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous, said: "I was outside with my friends, enjoying the DJ's beats when suddenly, we heard screams and people running towards us. We thought it was just another tourist looking for directions."<br/><br/>The investigation has revealed that the club's manager, a 30-year-old man named Vikram, had been trying to break the world record for most number of selfie sticks used in a single night. However, things took a turn for the worse when he accidentally set off the fireworks while taking a group shot with 50 random people. The resulting fire was so intense that it could have powered a small village's electricity needs for an entire week.<br/><br/>In related news, Vikram has been arrested and charged with "reckless endangerment of life" and "making a mess on the dance floor." His lawyer, a Bollywood actress named Raksha, said: "My client is innocent until proven guilty. And by 'innocent,' I mean he's not actually guilty – just really bad at math."<br/><br/>The Indian government has promised to take action against nightclubs that don't have adequate safety measures in place. In the meantime, tourists are advised to steer clear of any establishments with poor Wi-Fi connectivity or an over-reliance on EDM music.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The club's owner, a mysterious figure known only as "Daddy," has gone missing and is believed to be hiding in a small hut in the outskirts of Goa. When reached for comment, Daddy said: "I'm not afraid of you! I'll just make some tea and wait for the storm to pass."</p>
