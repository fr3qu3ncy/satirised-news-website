        <p>"WE CAN'T EVEN PLAY MUSIC, YOU'RE KILLING US!" - RESIDENTS TELL ELON MUSK OF LAKURAWA'S RULE<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, residents of Nukuru village in north-western Nigeria have come forward to complain about the harsh rules imposed by the militant group Lakurawa. But it's not just their freedom that's being stifled - it's also their right to rock out.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the Lakurawa militants have been preventing villagers from playing music on Christmas Day and beyond. "We can't even get our funk on," said a local farmer, who wished to remain anonymous (but was willing to reveal his love for disco). "They're like, 'No music, no happiness.' It's like, what kind of holiday is this?"<br/><br/>When asked about the rules, a spokesperson for Lakurawa (who just so happens to be a giant chicken named Cluck Norris) said, "We cannot live freely. You cannot even play music because it's distracting from our jihad. We have to focus on taking over the world... or at least the savannah plains."<br/><br/>The villagers are not alone in their suffering. In fact, residents of nearby villages are so desperate for a good dance party that they've started sneaking into Nukuru at night to play music under the light of the full moon.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the US air strikes on Lakurawa's camps have only made things worse. "We thought it was a surprise birthday party for our leader," said a villager who wished to remain anonymous (but had a wicked sense of humor). "But then we realized it was just Trump being Trump again."<br/><br/>As tensions rise between the villagers and Lakurawa, one thing is clear: no one wants to be on the receiving end of a drone strike while trying to jam out to some sick beats.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, Elton John has been spotted in Nukuru village, performing an impromptu concert for the residents. When asked about the situation, he simply said, "I'm here to bring people together... and also to play some music."</p>
