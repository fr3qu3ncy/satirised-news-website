        <h2>You Won't Believe What These Two Brothers Did When They Tried to Flee a Deadly Nightclub Fire in Goa!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Two Indian brothers who fled Goa after a nightclub fire killed 25 people were hilariously detained in Phuket, only to reveal they had been secretly competing on a Thai baking show and tried to use that as an excuse to get out of facing justice.</p>

        <p>Brothers Who Fled to Phuket After Deadly Nightclub Fire Get a Reality Check<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the two brothers who fled to Phuket after their nightclub in Goa caught fire, killing 25 people, were detained by Thai authorities. Gaurav and Saurabh Luthra, the owners of the ill-fated Birch By Romeo Lane club, thought they could outrun the law, but little did they know that even a monkey with a bad memory wouldn't forget their faces.<br/><br/>As it turns out, these two brothers were not just any ordinary nightclub owners. No, no! They were actually secretly competing in the Thai version of "The Great British Baking Show" and had to flee Phuket to avoid getting eliminated from the competition. Who knew that running a deadly nightclub fire was a good excuse to get out of baking?<br/><br/>When asked about their disappearance, Saurabh Luthra's social media statement read like a script from a bad Bollywood movie: "We undertake to co-operate with the police authorities... and submit ourselves to the jurisdiction of the police authorities... and the judicial system... of the country." Yeah, sure, buddy! Like nobody noticed you trying to sneak out of Goa without your pants.<br/><br/>The brothers' lawyer, who looked suspiciously like a cross between a snake oil salesman and a used car dealer, said they would return to India on Thursday and "submit themselves to the jurisdiction of the police authorities... and the judicial system... of the country." Yeah, right! Like anyone believed him. He probably promised to give them a free pair of flip-flops with every bribe.<br/><br/>In related news, the Indian government has announced plans to build a giant statue of Mahatma Gandhi in Phuket, who will be made to say "I'm sorry" 24/7 for eternity.<br/><br/>Update: The brothers have been spotted in a local Thai restaurant, ordering a plate of pad thai and trying to blend in with the locals. Little do they know that the waiter is actually an undercover detective, here to take them down... or at least get a good tip.</p>
