        <p>THE SUSPECT IN THE UNIVERSITY SHOOTING AND THE MURDER OF AN MIT PROFESSOR ENTERED THE US VIA A SCHEME, BUT NOW IT'S LIKE... "OH NO, WE JUST REALIZED WE SHOULD HAVE CHECKED FOR MENTAL ILLNESS"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the suspect in the Brown University shooting and the murder of an MIT professor has been found dead after entering the US via the Diversity Visa Program (DV1). Because what could possibly go wrong with a program that's just like... "Hey, let's pick some random people from countries with low immigration rates and give them a free pass to America!"? It's not like we have a whole department dedicated to vetting these folks or anything.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (okay, it was Kristi Noem), President Donald Trump has suspended the program because, apparently, the suspect who killed two people at Brown University and another professor in Massachusetts entered through this very scheme back in 2017. Who knew? I mean, it's not like we have an entire team of immigration experts just... waiting for someone to notice that maybe, just maybe, they shouldn't have let some dude with a PhD in physics join our country without doing a thorough background check.<br/><br/>And now, because this guy was apparently the ultimate multi-tasker (kill two people and study for a PhD at the same time), authorities are trying to figure out why he did what he did. Was it his love of Portugal? His hatred of America? His need for more gunpowder in his life? I mean, seriously, who needs that many guns?<br/><br/>"EVERYONE SAYS IT'LL NEVER BE ME"... EXCEPT WHEN IT IS<br/><br/>Brown University President Christina Paxson had this to say about the whole ordeal: "Valente was enrolled at Brown from 2000 to spring and was studying for a PhD in physics. He had no current active affiliation with Brown." Yeah, because that totally makes sense. I mean, who wouldn't want to spend all their time killing people and studying for a PhD? It's not like they have anything better to do... like, say, actually being human.<br/><br/>And let's talk about the victims for a second. There was Ella Cook, 19, and Mukhammad Aziz Umurzokov, 18. I mean, these two were just so full of life (not). It's a shame they got killed by some dude with too many guns and not enough mental health support.<br/><br/>SO, WHAT'S NEXT?<br/><br/>As for the program itself... well, it looks like we're all about to find out what happens when you don't have a plan B. Or C. Or D. I mean, who needs those when you've got an immigration system that's just... "Hey, here's your visa! Have fun in America!"? It's not like there are any consequences for letting someone with a questionable past into our country.<br/><br/>And now, because this is America and we love our guns almost as much as we love our confusion about what to do next, Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem has said she'll "pause" the visa scheme. Pause? As in... just pause? Like, temporarily? Until further notice? I mean, who needs a solid plan when you can just put everything on hold and hope for the best?<br/><br/>WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?<br/><br/>Okay, let's recap: we've got a guy who killed two people at Brown University and another professor in Massachusetts, all while being enrolled in a PhD program (because that's totally normal). He entered the country through this "diversity" visa program because... well, I'm not really sure why, but it sounds like some kind of joke. Now our government is trying to figure out what to do next.<br/><br/>ANYWAY<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! Just another day in America where everything's peachy keen until someone realizes they should have checked for mental illness before giving them a free pass to the country. Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling tale of government incompetence and general chaos!</p>
