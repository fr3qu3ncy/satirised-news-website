        <p>COMEDY VERSION OF THE NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>HEADLINE: "IRAN'S REGIME IS LIKE MY AUNTIE WHO WOULDN'T LEAVE EVEN WHEN EVERYONE ELSE HAD GONE HOME"<br/><br/>SUBHEADLINE: "The regime's opponents will hope for more pressure to accelerate the process, writes the BBC's international editor, while also secretly rooting for a cameo appearance by Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson to distract everyone from their woes."<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iran's authoritarian regime has refused to die, despite numerous attempts to assassinate it with sanctions, military blows, and a severe case of food price inflation (over 70% in just two years!). It's like my Auntie Agnes who just wouldn't leave the party even when everyone else had gone home.<br/><br/>The protesters, led by a motley crew of students, activists, and referees (yes, you read that right – referees!), have been trying to bring down the regime for weeks, but it's proving to be a bit like trying to get my cat to do tricks on command. It just won't budge.<br/><br/>At the forefront of this suppression is the Iranian Revolutionary Guards Corps (IRGC), an elite force with 150,000 men under arms and more firepower than a Justin Bieber concert. They're like the party poopers who always show up when you're trying to have fun.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The IRGC has its own auxiliary force, the Basij militia – think of them as the awkward cousins at the family reunion who just won't leave. With millions of members and a reputation for ruthlessness, they're like the ultimate party crashers.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, US President Donald Trump is still threatening to take action against Iran, much like my grandma threatens to cut me off from her inheritance if I don't behave. It's a bit like trying to reason with a toddler – you know it won't end well.<br/><br/>In the midst of all this chaos, the Iranian regime has decided to take a page out of its own playbook and start negotiating with the US. Because, as everyone knows, when in doubt, just call in an expert – in this case, a certain Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to distract everyone from their troubles.<br/><br/>As one observer noted, "It's hard to see how these two sides can make a deal over Iran's nuclear plans and ballistic missile programme that have defeated earlier rounds of talks." But hey, as long as The Rock is involved, who cares about the details?<br/><br/>And finally, we come to the conclusion that Iran's regime is like my Auntie Agnes – it just won't die. Yet. But when it does, it'll be like a fireworks display on New Year's Eve – sudden and utterly unexpected.<br/><br/>END OF COMEDY ARTICLE<br/><br/>(Note: This article is entirely fictional and not based on real events or people.
