        <p>Scientists have captured footage of killer whales and dolphins hunting together for the first time ever, but somehow that's not as exciting as a guy getting his leg stuck in quicksand or a landslip warning system being installed in Sussex.</p>

        <p>Cameramen on Killer Whales Record First Evidence of Joint Hunt with Dolphins, Plus Some Completely Unrelated Stuff<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, scientists have captured footage of killer whales and Pacific white-sided dolphins hunting together near the coast of British Columbia, Canada. Because who doesn't love a good game of "Whale-Hunt-Fun" with their dolphin friends? <br/><br/>According to researchers, this is the first recorded evidence of the two working together, which is just mind-blowing... said no one ever. The footage was captured using drones and camera tags to study the feeding behavior of these magnificent creatures.<br/><br/>Lead researcher Dr. Sarah Fortune from Dalhousie University in Canada (because Canadian universities have some of the best researchers, duh!) said that not only were the killer whales orienting themselves towards the dolphins at the surface, but when the dolphins started to dive, our tagged killer whales would start to dive... and then they all went out for beers together because, you know, teamwork.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! While we're on the topic of scientists capturing weird and wonderful footage, have you heard about the guy who got his leg stuck in quicksand? Yeah, that's a thing now. And it turns out, the guy was like, "I thought the ground was solid!"... same here, buddy.<br/><br/>On a completely unrelated note, did you know that there's a landslip early warning system installed by residents in Sussex? Because who doesn't love a good warning about impending doom?<br/><br/>And if all that wasn't enough, we also have the Venezuelan opposition leader Maria Corina Machado telling us that people risked their lives for her to come to Oslo... because when has being a Nobel Peace Prize laureate not been life-risking?<br/><br/>Oh, and did I mention that Farrah Robb from BBC Radio Scotland Breakfast wants the Tartan Army singing "My Song" at the World Cup? Because priorities, folks.<br/><br/>And finally, Dr. Xand is advising us not to buy branded cold and flu remedies... so don't bother with those fancy medicine bottles, just eat some chicken soup instead.<br/><br/>All this news in one place, because why not?!</p>
