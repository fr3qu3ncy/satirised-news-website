        <p>COMEDY VERSION<br/><br/>BREAKING: Hong Kong's Fire Service Loses Battle Against Blazing Inferno, Entire City Loses Battle Against Boredom<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the fire service in Hong Kong has managed to contain a massive blaze that consumed an entire housing complex. The real news, however, is that this has finally given everyone in the city something to talk about.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the flames spread so quickly that they had time to grab their phones and take selfies with the fire in the background. "I was like, 'OMG, my building's on fire! Should I be worried?' And then I remembered, it's just a Tuesday," said one resident.<br/><br/>The cause of the blaze has been attributed to a protective netting that failed to meet flame retardant standards. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the construction company involved in the project replied, "We're not sure what happened, but we're pretty sure it was someone else's fault."<br/><br/>Chief Executive John Lee has ordered an investigation into the matter, which will no doubt take three to four weeks and involve countless meetings and PowerPoint presentations. When asked about the possibility of resigning over this disaster, Lee responded, "Resign? Me? Never! I'll just add it to my resume as 'Experience in handling catastrophic fires'."<br/><br/>In related news, police have detained a 24-year-old man for suspected sedition, apparently because he was asking legitimate questions about the fire on social media. Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have both criticized this move, saying that "now is not the time for silencing citizens who dare to ask uncomfortable questions." When asked for comment, Lee simply shrugged and said, "Hey, someone's gotta keep the streets safe from dissenting opinions."<br/><br/>The residents of Wang Fuk Court housing complex have been left without a home, but they're taking it in stride. "I mean, it's not like we had anything better to do than just sit around and wait for our building to burn down," said one resident.<br/><br/>As the city continues to mourn the loss of 151 lives (and an entire afternoon's productivity), everyone is left wondering: what's next? Will the fire service be able to contain the flames of outrage? Will Lee finally address the elephant in the room (or at least the flaming inferno that destroyed our homes)? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The online petition calling for an independent inquiry into the fire has been removed, citing "reasons of national security." When asked about this development, a spokesperson for the government replied, "Don't worry, it's just a minor setback. We'll get back to you in three to four weeks with some bureaucratic nonsense that will further confuse everyone involved."<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks!</p>
