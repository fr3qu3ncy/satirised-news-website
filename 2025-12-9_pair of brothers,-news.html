        <p>GOA NIGHTCLUB OWNERS FLED TO THAILAND IN A BLAZING PASTRY-CREAM-FILLED VAN HOURS AFTER DEADLY FIRE<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the owners of a nightclub in Goa, India, where a devastating fire killed 25 people on Sunday, fled the country hours after the tragedy, police have said. But here's the thing - they didn't just sneak out with some luggage and a plane ticket like most people would. No, these two brothers, Saurabh and Gaurav Luthra, decided to make a grand exit in style.<br/><br/>They boarded a flight to Phuket in Thailand, but not before stopping at a local bakery to pick up a few dozen freshly baked croissants and a tub of their favorite pastry cream. Because, you know, when the going gets tough, the tough get baked.<br/><br/>Investigators believe the fierce blaze was triggered by fireworks being set off inside the venue, Birch By Romeo Lane, which is located in a busy nightlife area of Goa. But what they don't know is that Saurabh and Gaurav had secretly been taking pyrotechnic lessons from a team of highly trained pandas.<br/><br/>The majority of the victims were staff members, while four were holidaymakers visiting from Delhi. Five people are still being treated in hospital. And let's be real, they're probably just waiting for their pastry cream to settle before they can even think about suing the Luthra brothers.<br/><br/>Police have appealed to Interpol for help to find and arrest the Luthra brothers. But sources close to the investigation say they've been having a tough time tracking them down - mainly because they kept changing their social media handles to "Pierre" and "Suzanne."<br/><br/>In a statement on social media, Saurabh Luthra expressed "profound grief", but not before taking a selfie with his pastry cream-filled van. His brother Gaurav Luthra has not commented publicly, but is believed to be in hiding with a group of heavily armed, pastry-loving ninja warriors.<br/><br/>At least four people were arrested in the immediate aftermath of the fire, including the venue's manager - who was later released on bail after posting a $100 million bond in the form of a 10-tonne shipment of croissants.<br/><br/>POLICE RAID ON LUTRA BROTHERS' HOME FOILED BY INFLATABLE DANCE PARTY<br/><br/>Police said they travelled to Delhi to carry out a raid on the mens' home, but discovered that it had been transformed into an inflatable dance party. That's right - Saurabh and Gaurav had turned their house into a giant bounce castle filled with glitter, confetti, and a never-ending playlist of disco classics.<br/><br/>"It shows their intent to avoid police investigation," Goa police said in a statement. "But mainly it just shows they're really good at party planning."<br/><br/>LUTRA BROTHERS' PAIRTY CREAM-FILLED VAN SEEN SPEEDING AWAY FROM SCENE OF CRIME<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses reported seeing the Luthra brothers speeding away from the scene of the crime in their pastry cream-filled van, which was emblazoned with a giant banner that read "FLEEDIN' GOODTIME".<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Saurabh and Gaurav were unavailable - they were too busy taking a 12-hour nap to recharge their batteries after a long night of partying.<br/><br/>UPDATE: LUTRA BROTHERS NOW WANTED IN 47 COUNTRIES FOR "CRIME AGAINST PAstry LOGIC"<br/><br/>The list of countries where the Luthra brothers are now wanted for crimes against pastry logic has grown to 47, including Iceland, Albania, and the Cook Islands.<br/><br/>In a statement, Interpol said: "We're doing our best to track them down, but it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack - or in this case, a pastry cream-filled van in a crowded nightclub."</p>
