        <p>Peter Arnett: The War Correspondent Who Fought for the Truth, and a Free Lunch<br/><br/>In shocking news, Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Peter Arnett has died at the age of 91. But don't worry, he's not going to be missed... by his in-laws, anyway. See, Peter was known for covering some of the most intense conflicts of our time - Vietnam, the Gulf War, and even a secret hideout in Afghanistan where he interviewed Osama Bin Laden (who, btw, promised him a "surprise" that would be covered in the media... just kidding, it never happened).<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: who is this Peter Arnett guy? Well, let me tell you - he was like the Robert De Niro of war correspondents. Except instead of saying "You talkin' to me?" he'd say "I'm reporting live from Baghdad, and there's a nice view of the Eiffel Tower behind me... just kidding, it's just rubble!"<br/><br/>But seriously, Peter Arnett was one of the bravest journalists of his time. He reported on some of the most intense conflicts in history, often finding himself in the midst of explosions and air-raid sirens (which, by the way, he once described as "just a minor technical difficulty"). And yet, despite being in harm's way, he always managed to file a report that would make his editors back at CNN go "Whoa, nice work, Peter!"<br/><br/>In fact, it was during one of these reporting assignments that Peter first met his wife, Nina Nguyen (who, rumor has it, was the only person who could calm him down when he got too excited about a scoop). And speaking of scoops, let's just say that Peter had some doozies - like the time he interviewed Saddam Hussein and asked him if he'd ever consider getting a makeover (Saddam just laughed and said "No way, I'm perfect just the way I am").<br/><br/>But what really made Peter Arnett stand out was his reporting style. See, instead of just reading from a script, he'd often improvise on-air - which led to some... interesting moments. Like the time he accidentally swore live on CNN (oops), or the time he tried to interview a group of North Korean children who were too busy playing accordions to talk to him (um, what's up with that?).<br/><br/>Anyway, Peter Arnett will be deeply missed by his friends and family - but let's be real, he was always getting into trouble. As one friend said, "He was like a brother... except when we went on vacation together, and then I'd have to bail him out of jail for something stupid."<br/><br/>So here's to Peter Arnett: may you rest in peace, and may your reporting style inspire future generations of journalists to always keep it real - even if that means accidentally broadcasting live from the middle of a battlefield.<br/><br/>Related News<br/><br/>* Peter Arnett's Most Epic Reporting Fails<br/>* The Time Peter Arnett Interviewed Saddam Hussein (and Got a Free Lunch Out of It)<br/>* Peter Arnett's Top 10 Reporting Moments (and Why They Were So Epic)</p>
