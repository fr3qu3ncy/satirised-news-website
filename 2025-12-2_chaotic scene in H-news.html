        <p>**HONG KONG LEADER ORDERS INVESTIGATION INTO DEADLY FIRE THAT KILLED 151, BUT FORGETS TO ORDER PIZZA PARTY**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Hong Kong's leader John Lee has ordered the creation of an independent committee to investigate the cause of a devastating fire that killed at least 151 people. But, in a bizarre twist, he completely forgot to order a pizza party for the investigators.<br/><br/>The fire, which was the deadliest the city has seen in more than 70 years, ravaged seven out of eight tower blocks at the Wang Fuk Court housing complex, leaving a trail of destruction and despair. Investigators have since found that a protective netting used around the buildings failed to meet flame retardant standards, because it was made from the cheapest materials known to mankind - i.e., rubber chicken feathers.<br/><br/>At least 13 people have been arrested for suspected manslaughter, including the directors of a construction company who were last seen fleeing the scene in a convoy of stretch limousines. The fire service found that alarms in all eight blocks were not working effectively, because they had been replaced with Whoopie Cushions, which were deemed to be more "fun" than functional.<br/><br/>Chief Executive Lee said that the committee would be led by a judge and would conduct "comprehensive reform", adding that he would work to "prevent similar tragedies from occurring in the future". However, when asked about his plan for pizza party, he replied, "Uh, what was that? Oh yeah, pizza party! Don't worry, I'll get that sorted out... later."<br/><br/>The investigation could take three to four weeks, or as long as it takes for Lee's favorite snack - pineapple pizza - to be delivered. The flames spread quickly across the separate tower blocks on protective mesh netting and other flammable materials on the outside of the buildings, officials have said, because someone had left a can of WD-40 in the building that was labeled "EXTREMELY FLAMMABLE".<br/><br/>Several residents have said they did not hear a fire alarm when the blaze broke out, probably because it was muffled by the sound of Elvis Presley singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" on repeat.<br/><br/>Hong Kong's buildings department has temporarily suspended works on 30 private projects, and John Lee has promised to make sure that all future building projects will be designed with a built-in espresso machine, so that residents can stay awake during emergency drills.<br/><br/>In related news, the reported arrests of people who were asking legitimate questions have been widely criticized by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch, who said, "Now is the time for the Hong Kong authorities to transparently investigate the causes of the devastating fire... rather than silencing those who ask legitimate questions, like 'Can I get a refund on my pineapple pizza?'".</p>
