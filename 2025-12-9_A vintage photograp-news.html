        <p>BREAKING: Zohran Mamdani Abandons Rent-Stabilised Apartment for Gracie Mansion, but Not Before it Becomes a Hotspot for Uninvited Guests<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, New York City Mayor-Elect Zohran Mamdani has abandoned his rent-stabilised apartment in the borough of Queens to take up residence in the historic Gracie Mansion. The decision comes after a heated debate during his campaign, where he tied his core platform - freeze the rent - to his own housing situation.<br/><br/>But it seems that Mamdani's new pad is not as quiet and peaceful as one might expect. Eyewitnesses claim that the mansion has become a hotspot for uninvited guests, including ghosts from the past. Chirlane McCray, wife of former mayor Bill De Blasio, alleged that doors occasionally opened and closed by themselves, and the floorboards creaked eerily.<br/><br/>"I'm not saying it's true," said Mamdani in a statement on Monday, "but I've heard rumors that the mansion is haunted by the spirits of past mayors. Maybe it's just my imagination, but I keep seeing a ghostly figure of Michael Bloomberg wandering around, muttering something about 'affordable housing' and 'tax cuts'."<br/><br/>As for Mamdani's current apartment in Astoria, records show he paid about $2,300 (£1,725) each month. The average rent for a one-bedroom apartment in New York City is $3,500 (£2,625) a month. It seems that Mamdani will be trading in his modest digs for a life of luxury and mystery at Gracie Mansion.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Ghostly Encounters Reported at Gracie Mansion<br/><br/>According to sources close to the mayor-elect, strange occurrences have been reported at Gracie Mansion since Mamdani's arrival. Staff members claim to have seen ghostly apparitions of past mayors, including Fiorello La Guardia and Ed Koch.<br/><br/>One staff member, who wished to remain anonymous, described an encounter with a ghostly figure dressed in a suit and tie. "It was like he stepped out of the 1950s or something," said the staffer. "I was like, 'Hello?' And then I realized it wasn't just me being crazy."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, rumors have been circulating about Mamdani's decision to bring his pet chicken, Cluck Norris, into Gracie Mansion. Insiders claim that Cluck has become a favorite among staff members and is often seen pecking at crumbs on the floor.<br/><br/>As for Mamdani's plans to freeze the rent, it remains to be seen whether he will follow through on his campaign promise. One thing is certain, however: Gracie Mansion will never be the same again.<br/><br/>Related Articles<br/><br/>* "Zohran Mamdani Abandons Rent-Stabilised Apartment for Luxurious Life at Gracie Mansion"<br/>* "Ghostly Encounters Reported at Gracie Mansion Since Mayor-Elect's Arrival"<br/>* "Cluck Norris, the Pet Chicken of New York City's Next Mayor"</p>
