        <p>RUSSIA GETS DRONE STRIKED (OR DID THEY?)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russia has accused Ukraine of launching a drone attack on one of President Vladimir Putin's residences. But wait, it gets better! The drones were allegedly intercepted by Russian air defence systems and destroyed with ease. Yeah, because that never happens in video games.<br/><br/>President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine, known for his serious expression and impeccable fashion sense (who wouldn't wear a black jacket with a black shirt to a press conference?), denied the allegations and called them "typical Russian lies". Ah, classic move, Volodymyr. You're like a superhero, always ready to save the day... from getting sued by Russia.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Kremlin (okay, it was just Yuri Ushakov, a Kremlin foreign policy aide), Putin had a very animated conversation with President Trump about the alleged drone attack. Trump initially seemed clueless, but then suddenly remembered that Putin told him about the whole thing over coffee and pastries. Trump's response? "Well, we'll find out... or maybe not. You know what they say: 'you can't believe everything you see on CNN'."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the White House has confirmed that President Trump concluded a positive call with Putin, but didn't mention anything about the alleged drone attack. What a coincidence! It's like they say: "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade... and then pretend the lemons never existed".<br/><br/>In related news, Ukraine's leader described territorial issues and the Russian-occupied Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant as the last unresolved matters in peace talks with the US. Yeah, because those aren't already major problems. I mean, who needs a functional nuclear power plant when you can have a nice game of "Drones vs. Russians"?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling saga of drone attacks, broken promises, and presidential misunderstandings!</p>
