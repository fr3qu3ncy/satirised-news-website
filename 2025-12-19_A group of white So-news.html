    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>In a hilarious display of international relations, South Africa has effectively told President Trump to "get over itself" after his tantrum over a raid on a refugee centre was met with a collective eye-roll from the country's officials and a shrug by its president.</p>

        <p>SOUTH AFRICA DEFIES TRUMP'S TANTRUMS OVER REFUGEE CENTRE RAID<br/><br/>In a bold move, South Africa has told the US to "get over itself" after President Donald Trump threatened "severe consequences" over a raid on a refugee centre processing applications by white South Africans for asylum in the US.<br/><br/>The raid, which saw seven Kenyans expelled from South Africa for working in the country illegally, was deemed a "major victory" by South African authorities. However, the US claimed that the Kenyans were not actually working at the centre, but were instead participating in a secret underground hip hop dance crew known as "The Refugee Renegades".<br/><br/>Trump, who has been busy tweeting about his own hair and how great it is, took to Twitter to claim that the South African government was "harassing" American officials. However, sources close to the South African government revealed that the US officials were actually just trying to get a good selfie with the President's hair.<br/><br/>The row began when the US accused South Africa of publishing the passport details of its officials, claiming this was an "unacceptable" breach of security. However, it later emerged that the details were actually leaked by a mischievous group of capybaras who had infiltrated the government's computer systems.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has continued to claim that Afrikaners are being subjected to a "genocide" in South Africa, despite evidence suggesting that this is not actually true. In fact, it was revealed that the only genocide happening in South Africa is of the country's national dish, bobotie, which is apparently being replaced by a new trend of "influencer sushi".<br/><br/>As tensions between the two countries continue to rise, South African authorities have been seen practicing their best "I'm not impressed" faces in front of mirrors. When asked for comment, President Cyril Ramaphosa simply shrugged and said "Mmm, bobotie..."<br/><br/>WHITE SOUTH AFRICANS DIVIDED ON US REFUGEE OFFER<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a survey has found that white South Africans are divided on the US offer of refugee status. While some welcomed the opportunity to flee their homeland, others were more concerned about the impact on their Instagram followers.<br/><br/>"We're not sure if we want to leave," said one Afrikaner. "I mean, I've got a great account with 10,000 followers and I don't think it would be easy to rebuild that from scratch in the US."<br/><br/>RAMAPHOSA STRUGGLES TO MEND FENCES WITH TRUMP<br/><br/>In an attempt to repair relations between the two countries, President Ramaphosa was seen practicing his best "sorry not sorry" face. However, sources close to the US government revealed that Trump was still not happy and demanded a selfie with Ramaphosa's hair instead.<br/><br/>UNPACKING THE SOUTH AFRICAN LAND LAW THAT SO INFLAMES TRUMP<br/><br/>Experts have been trying to explain to Trump why the South African land law is actually quite sensible. However, it seems that Trump is more interested in building a wall around his own estate to keep out any pesky capybaras.<br/><br/>DO AFRIKANERS WANT TO TAKE TRUMP UP ON HIS SOUTH AFRICAN REFUGEE OFFER?<br/><br/>In related news, Afrikaners have been spotted flocking to their local libraries to research the best ways to immigrate to the US. However, when asked if they wanted to take Trump up on his offer, one said "Uh, no thanks, I think we'll just stick with our current health insurance plan."<br/><br/>KENYAN COURT SUSPENDS 'LANDMARK' US HEALTH AID DEAL OVER DATA PRIVACY CONCERNS<br/><br/>In a separate development, the Kenyan court has suspended a landmark US healthcare aid deal over data privacy concerns. However, it seems that the main concern is actually just trying to get their hands on some of Trump's hair gel.<br/><br/>LURED BY LUCRATIVE JOB OFFERS AND SENT TO FIGHT FOR RUSSIA - KENYANS WANT THEIR SONS BACK<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kenyan families are demanding the return of their sons who were lured by lucrative job offers and sent to fight for Russia. However, it seems that the main concern is actually just trying to get them back so they can watch more cat videos.<br/><br/>WOLVAARDT HITS CENTURY AS SOUTH AFRICA DEFEAT IRISH<br/><br/>In sports news, Laura Wolvaardt made an unbeaten century as South Africa beat Ireland by six wickets in Johannesburg. However, it seems that the real winner was actually just her Instagram followers who got to see some great photos of her celebrating with a selfie stick.<br/><br/>(Note: This is a work of satire and not meant to be taken seriously)</p>
