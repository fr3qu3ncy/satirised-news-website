        <p>BREAKING: Kast Wins Presidential Election, Promises to Make Chile Great Again (But Mostly Just Lock Up a Lot of People)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, José Antonio Kast has been elected as the next President of Chile, promising to make the country "free from crime, free from anguish, and free from fear" - mainly by locking up anyone who might be committing any kind of crime. The far-right candidate, who has openly praised Chile's former dictator Augusto Pinochet, won with over 58% of the vote in his third attempt at running for president.<br/><br/>Kast Vows to Build a Wall (Not on the Southern Border, but Everywhere)<br/><br/>In a move that will surely make Donald Trump proud, Kast promised to build a border wall... on Chile's porous frontier with Peru and Bolivia. Because, you know, those countries are just teeming with undocumented migrants looking to cause chaos in Chile.<br/><br/>Chileans Cheer as Kast Promises to "Lock Up" Those Pesky Undocumented Migrants<br/><br/>At a victory rally, Kast's supporters were overheard chanting "Make Chile Great Again!" and wearing red caps that read "Kast 2024" (because, you know, it's already 2023, but who's counting?). One enthusiastic supporter, Augustina Trancoso, donned a red cap and declared, "I'm happy we can recover the country's security and patriotism... and maybe even get our Instagram followers up to par with those cool Brazilian influencers!"<br/><br/>Critics Say Kast's Promises Are Just a Lot of Hot Air (Literally)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, critics pointed out that Chile is already one of the safest countries in South America, and that Kast's promises were just a bunch of hot air. "In other countries, there are much worse things happening than here," said Javiera Carrasco, who voted for Communist Party member Jeannette Jara (the left-wing coalition candidate). "It just doesn't add up for me." Another critic, Hector Lunes, quipped, "Kast says he wants to expel 360,000 undocumented migrants. He won't be able to do that. It's physically impossible... unless he's planning on deporting every single Chilean who's ever had a beer in a foreign country."<br/><br/>Pinochet's Legacy Lives On (Apparently)<br/><br/>It turns out Kast's family has some interesting connections - his brother was a minister during Pinochet's dictatorship, and his father was a member of the Nazi party. Whoops. One voter, Ricardo Herrera, pointed out that Kast's election marks a return to Chile's far-right past. "Kast's family helped the dictator Augusto Pinochet," he said. "It was brutal... for anyone who wasn't part of the ruling class, that is."<br/><br/>Stay Tuned for More Updates on Kast's Presidency (or Lack Thereof)<br/><br/>As Kast prepares to take office in March next year, we can only wonder what kind of exciting chaos will ensue. Will he actually follow through on his promises? Will he manage to deport all those undocumented migrants without causing a global economic crisis? Only time - and probably a lot of lawsuits - will tell!</p>
