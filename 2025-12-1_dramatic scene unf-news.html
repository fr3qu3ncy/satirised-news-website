        <p>**DOZENS STILL MISSING AS DEADLY LANDSLIDE HITS TWO BOATS IN PERU, RESCUE EFFORTS HINDERED BY STRONG CURRENTS AND A SINGER FROM "Glee" SINGING THE MACARENA**<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, rescue efforts in Peru's central Ucayali region are being hindered by strong currents on the river, one official said. But that's not all - it turns out that one of the boats that sank was carrying a secret stash of Donuts from Krispy Kreme, and the smell of sugar and grease has caused many of the rescue workers to break into spontaneous dance.<br/><br/>At least 12 people have died and around 50 are still missing after a landslide struck two boats docked at a river port in Peru's Amazon rainforest region. But don't worry, the victims' families are being comforted by none other than Sue Sylvester from the TV show "Glee," who has arrived on the scene to sing a rousing rendition of the Macarena.<br/><br/>The landslide sank a ferry and seriously damaged another passenger vessel that had dozens of people on board, including a group of accountants who were trying to get to their weekly golf game. As one official said, "It was like a scene from 'Titanic' - but with more paperwork."<br/><br/>Rescue operations have been hindered by the fast-flowing river waters, which have also caused several rescue boats to be swept away in a freak accident involving a group of rowdy otters.<br/><br/>Children, teachers and doctors were among the passengers on one of the boats, which was traveling towards the riverside communities of Caco Macaya, Curiaca del Caco, and Pueblo Nuevo del Caco. But don't worry, they've all been accounted for - well, most of them have, anyway.<br/><br/>As the rescue efforts continue, authorities are working with families gathered at the scene of the disaster to try to determine exactly how many people still need to be found. And in a bizarre twist, it's been discovered that one of the missing passengers is actually a professional snail trainer who was on his way to compete in the Peruvian Snail Racing Championships.<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/><br/>Reports are coming in that the rescue efforts have been further hindered by the arrival of a group of wild monkeys who have stolen several rescue boats and are now using them as makeshift playground equipment. It's unclear how this will affect the search for the missing snail trainer, but one thing is certain - it's going to be a long day in Peru.</p>
