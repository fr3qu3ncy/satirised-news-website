        <p>EU Reaches South America Trade Deal After 25 Years of Talks, Despite Protests from Farmers Who Were Too Busy Playing Mario Kart to Care<br/><br/>In a move that has left farmers in several European countries scratching their heads and wondering what all the fuss was about, the EU has finally reached a free trade agreement with Brazil, Argentina, Paraguay, and Uruguay. The deal, which was negotiated over 25 years ago, is being hailed as a "historic day for multilateralism" by Brazilian President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, who was too busy sipping caipirinhas to notice the protests from European farmers.<br/><br/>The EU Commission's Ursula von der Leyen was seen beaming with pride as she announced the deal, which will bring in €4 billion ($4.7 billion, £3.5 billion) a year in export duties for local companies. However, not everyone is happy about the agreement, particularly the farmers who were too busy playing Mario Kart to care.<br/><br/>"We're thrilled that the EU has finally reached an agreement with our South American friends," said a spokesperson for a Belgian young farmers' group. "However, we're still trying to figure out how to get the tractor out of the mud."<br/><br/>The protests, which took place on a motorway south of Brussels, featured tractors flying French flags and a red tractor that was seen making a break for it, only to be stopped by a group of angry farmers wielding pitchforks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, European leaders were seen high-fiving each other and singing "La Cucaracha" as they celebrated the deal. "This agreement is a signal in favor of international trade as a driver of economic growth," said President Lula, who was overheard whispering to himself, "And maybe I can finally get that new golf cart I've been eyeing."<br/><br/>The EU Commission has promised to listen to the concerns of farmers and introduce "robust safeguards" to protect their livelihoods in the agreement. However, sources close to the Commission have revealed that these safeguards are actually just a bunch of meaningless buzzwords that were inserted at the last minute to placate the farmers.<br/><br/>As for the environmental commitments made by the South American countries, Cecilia Malmström, a former European commissioner for trade, was overheard saying, "Oh, don't worry about those, they're just a bunch of feel-good nonsense. We'll just ignore them and hope no one notices."<br/><br/>The deal still needs to be approved by the European Parliament, but insiders say it's a done deal. After all, who doesn't love a good trade agreement?</p>
