        <p>BREAKING: Minneapolis Protesters Still Mad About ICE, But Mostly Just Bored<br/><br/>MINNEAPOLIS, MN - Thousands of people gathered in the freezing cold on Saturday to protest the death of Renee Good, who was shot by an ICE agent while trying to do a three-point turn. Because, you know, that's exactly what happens when you try to turn around with your car.<br/><br/>The protesters were joined by Mayor Jacob Frey, who proudly announced that "tens of thousands" of people attended the rally and march, which started in Powderhorn Park. That's like, a whole lot of people! We're pretty sure they all came from the nearby Olive Garden buffet, where they were protesting the lack of breadsticks.<br/><br/>The protest was peaceful, except for the part where someone threw a chunk of ice at a police officer and hit them in the face. But that's just a minor detail. The protesters were mostly just there to enjoy the nice winter weather and complain about ICE agents being mean to their friends.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, three congresswomen from Minnesota tried to tour an ICE facility but were told to leave because they didn't give seven days' notice. We're not sure what's more ridiculous, that or the fact that they thought they could just waltz in there without permission like they owned the place (which, let's be real, is probably exactly what they thought).<br/><br/>The city officials are still trying to figure out how to handle all these protests, but we think the solution is simple: just give everyone free hot chocolate and a participation trophy. Problem solved!<br/><br/>UPDATE: The US vice-president has weighed in on the situation, saying that the investigation into Renee Good's death is a federal issue. Yeah, because nothing says "federal issue" like a woman being shot while trying to turn around in her car.<br/><br/>And finally, we'd like to take a moment to acknowledge the bravery of Jonathan Ross, the ICE agent who fired on Renee Good and has since become a local hero (in our own humble opinion). We're pretty sure he's still shaking his head saying "I told you so" while trying to calm down his shaken nerves.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from Minneapolis, where the protests will likely continue until someone gets arrested or runs out of hot chocolate.</p>
