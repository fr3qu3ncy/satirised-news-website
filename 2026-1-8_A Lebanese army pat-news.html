        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>LEBANESE ARMY SAYS IT HAS TAKEN OVER SECURITY IN HEZBOLLAH-DOMINATED SOUTH, BUT NETFLIX'S STRANGER THINGS CREW SHOWS UP UNEXPECTEDLY AND STARTS FIGHTING WITH ISRAELI SOLDIERS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Lebanese army has announced that it has successfully taken over security in the south of the country, which had been dominated by Hezbollah for decades. However, things took a strange turn when a crew from Netflix's Stranger Things suddenly appeared on the scene and started causing chaos.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report seeing the Mind Flayer himself, flanked by Eleven and Mike Wheeler, charging towards Israeli soldiers with a group of Demogorgons. The Israeli soldiers, caught off guard, quickly retreated to their tanks, where they proceeded to have an epic dance battle with the Stranger Things crew.<br/><br/>"I was just minding my own business when suddenly this weirdo in a duster coat shows up and starts fighting our guys," said an Israeli soldier, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, I've seen some crazy things in my time, but this takes the cake."<br/><br/>The Lebanese army, meanwhile, seemed completely unbothered by the sudden appearance of supernatural creatures on their territory. In fact, they even joined in on the dance battle, busting out their best disco moves to the tune of "Stayin' Alive".<br/><br/>"This is a great opportunity for us to show the world that we can handle any situation," said a Lebanese army spokesperson. "And if Stranger Things wants to come and hang out with us, that's just fabulous."<br/><br/>The office of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu released a statement saying that efforts toward fully disarming Hezbollah were "an encouraging beginning, but they are far from sufficient, as evidenced by Hezbollah's efforts to rearm and rebuild its terror infrastructure with Iranian support... and now also with supernatural creatures from the Upside Down".<br/><br/>In related news, the United Nations peacekeeping force in southern Lebanon (Unifil) has reported seeing no indication that Hezbollah is rebuilding its infrastructure in the areas where it operates. However, they did report seeing a group of kids from Hawkins, Indiana, playing soccer on the beach.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>The Lebanese army has just announced that it will continue taking over security from armed groups, but only if they agree to participate in a game of "Never Have I Ever" with them. Meanwhile, the Stranger Things crew has been spotted enjoying shawarma and laughing at the Israeli soldiers' dance moves.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
