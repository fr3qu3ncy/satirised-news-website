        <h2>"CLIMBERS WARNED: NEW 'TRASH TAX' TO BE IMPOSED ON MOUNT EVEREST - YOU'LL PAY $4,000 FOR OTHERS TO CLEAN UP AFTER YOU!"</h2>

        <p>Nepal has scrapped its failed $4,000 deposit scheme to encourage climbers to take their Mount Everest trash back down, and is instead introducing a non-refundable "trash tax" of $4,000 per person to pay for Sherpa cleanup crews to deal with the mess themselves.</p>

        <p>Breaking News:<br/><br/>Mount Everest's Waste Deposit Scheme is a Complete and Utter Failure!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Nepalese authorities have scrapped the "failed" Mount Everest waste deposit scheme, which was designed to encourage climbers to bring their trash back down from the world's highest peak. The scheme, which was introduced 11 years ago, required climbers to pay a $4,000 deposit that would be returned if they brought at least 8kg of waste back down with them.<br/><br/>But, it turns out, most climbers were like the infamous "Party Boy" Davey from reality TV show "Temptation Island" - they just couldn't be bothered. And so, the rubbish kept piling up, much to the dismay of local Sherpas, who had to deal with the mess.<br/><br/>"I mean, come on! It's not like we're asking them to bring back a whole elephant or something," said Tshering Sherpa, chief executive officer of the Sagarmatha Pollution Control Committee. "Just a few kilos of trash would be nice. But no, these climbers are like the Kardashians - they only care about themselves and their Instagram followers."<br/><br/>Under the failed scheme, most of the deposit money was refunded over the years, but the rubbish problem persisted. And why? Because the higher camps where the garbage problem is worst were not being monitored properly.<br/><br/>"It's like trying to catch a greased pig at a county fair," said Mingma Sherpa, chairperson of the Pasang Lhamu rural municipality. "You think you've got it all under control, but then the pig slips away and makes a mess everywhere."<br/><br/>So, what's next? Well, Nepalese authorities are hoping that a new scheme will be more effective in tackling the rubbish problem on Mount Everest.<br/><br/>Starting next year, climbers will have to pay a non-refundable clean-up fee of $4,000 per person - which is essentially just a fancy name for a "trash tax." The money will go towards setting up a checkpoint at Camp Two and deploying mountain rangers to monitor the higher camps.<br/><br/>And if you're thinking, "But wait, this sounds like more bureaucracy," well, you'd be right. It's basically just a bunch of government officials trying to cover their behinds while making sure the Sherpas do all the hard work.<br/><br/>"I mean, we're not asking for much," said Tshering Sherpa. "Just a few kilos of trash and some decent infrastructure would be nice."<br/><br/>So, if you're planning on climbing Mount Everest next year, just remember: it's not just about reaching the summit - it's also about bringing back your trash and making sure the Sherpas are happy.<br/><br/>Update: We've just received word that Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has announced plans to climb Mount Everest next year. When asked about the rubbish problem, he replied, "Can you smell what The Rock is cookin'? I'll bring back so much trash, it'll be like a garbage truck explosion up there!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
