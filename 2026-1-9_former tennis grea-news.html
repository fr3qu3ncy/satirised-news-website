        <p>Stan Wawrinka Receives an Australian Open Wildcard as He Begins the Final Season of His Career, but Australian Nick Kyrgios Misses Out... and Other Stuff<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former tennis great Stan Wawrinka has been handed an Australian Open wildcard as he begins the final season of his career. But wait, there's more! Australian Nick Kyrgios was supposed to get it, but instead, he decided to enter the men's doubles competition because, let's be real, five-set matches are just too much for him.<br/><br/>As Wawrinka prepares to bid farewell to professional tennis, he's been awarded a spot in the biggest tournament of the year. And by "biggest", we mean the one with the most tourists wearing novelty hats and carrying inflatable flamingos. Yes, it's that kind of crowd.<br/><br/>"I'm thrilled to receive this wildcard," said Wawrinka, who's probably just excited to get back on court and show off his sweet single backhand. "I mean, who doesn't love a good farewell tour?"<br/><br/>But what about Kyrgios? Did we mention he was supposed to be the one with the wildcard? Well, it turns out that tennis is like a bad boyfriend - it's all about breaking your heart and making you doubt yourself. And in this case, it's because Kyrgios decided to focus on doubles instead.<br/><br/>"I'm not ready for five-set matches," said Kyrgios, who's probably just trying to avoid the humiliation of getting destroyed by some 15-year-old prodigy. "But I'll be back next year, and trust me, you won't want to miss it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, tournament director Craig Tiley is probably just relieved that someone else got left out of the wildcard equation. I mean, who doesn't love a good controversy?<br/><br/>And in other news, have you seen the new line of tennis-themed socks that are all the rage among tennis fans? They're basically just plain white socks with some fancy stripes on them.
