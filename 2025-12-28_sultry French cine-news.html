        <p>COMEDY VERSION<br/><br/>"BARDOT BEATS THE SYSTEM: FRENCH CINEMA ICON DIES AT 91, LEAVING BEHIND A TRAIL OF CONTROVERSY AND DOGGY LOVE"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, French cinema icon Brigitte Bardot has passed away at the ripe age of 91. But don't worry, folks, she's not going down without a fight... or a few choice words.<br/><br/>As a symbol of sexual liberation in the 1950s, Bardot was like a blonde bombshell (no pun intended) who could get away with just about anything on screen. And by "anything," we mean playing a sex-crazed teenager in movies that would make even the most seasoned R-rated film feel tame.<br/><br/>But as she got older and wiser, Bardot's views on life became, shall we say, a bit more... interesting. She started making homophobic slurs left and right (because who needs allies when you're trying to be edgy?), and was fined multiple times for inciting racial hatred. Because nothing says "classy" like a French aristocrat with a bad attitude.<br/><br/>And let's not forget her love of animals! Bardot founded the Brigitte Bardot Foundation, which is dedicated to protecting wild and domestic animals from... well, whatever evil forces might be threatening them. We're guessing it's probably just a bunch of jealous hippos who can't stand being outshone by a legendary blonde bombshell.<br/><br/>But in all seriousness (just for a second, we promise), Bardot will be remembered as a trailblazer in the world of cinema and animal welfare. And if you don't like that, well... YOU'RE JUST A HATER (Sorry, we couldn't resist).<br/><br/>As her friends and fans mourn the loss of this larger-than-life figure, they're also remembering her for one thing: her impeccable sense of style. Who else could pull off a pair of high heels, a blonde bouffant, and a scowl that says "I'm not afraid of you, buster"? It's a legacy that will live on forever... or at least until the next big celebrity scandal comes along.<br/><br/>"BARDOT: THE ULTIMATE FRENCH ICON (AND PROBABLY A LITTLE BIT NAUGHTY)"<br/><br/>In related news, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation has released a statement saying they're "immensely sad" to announce her passing. And by "immensely sad," we mean they're probably just really excited that she's finally out of their hair.<br/><br/>As the world says goodbye to this iconic woman, let's take a moment to remember her greatest achievements:<br/><br/>* She was the first person to make a career out of being hot.<br/>* She single-handedly kept the animal welfare industry in business for decades.<br/>* And she proved that even in your 90s, you can still throw some serious shade.<br/><br/>RIP, Brigitte. May your legacy live on forever... or at least until someone comes along and steals the spotlight with an even more outrageous scandal.</p>
