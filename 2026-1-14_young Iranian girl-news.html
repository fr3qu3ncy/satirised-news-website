        <p>Distressing Footage Reveals Nearly 200 Bodies, with One Victim Identified as Young as 16...and a Cameo by Elton John<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, distressing videos have emerged from a mortuary in Tehran, showing rows of bodies and blood-soaked floors. But that's not all - the footage also features a surprise appearance by none other than Elton John, who's been moonlighting as a body bag wrangler.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation (okay, it was just a guy on Twitter), nearly 200 bodies are strewn throughout the mortuary complex, many with visible wounds and one victim identified as young as 16. But don't worry, the teen in question is doing fine - they're currently undergoing intensive therapy to deal with the trauma of being in a body bag.<br/><br/>Anti-government demonstrations have spread to more than 68 towns and cities, verified videos show (or at least that's what we're told). The near-total internet blackout imposed by the government has left over 90 million Iranians struggling to find WiFi - or more likely, Netflix content.<br/><br/>The number of people who've been killed in the protests is still unknown, but HRANA estimates it's somewhere between "a lot" and "too many." An Iranian official previously told Reuters that 2,000 people have been killed (but claimed those responsible were actually just a bunch of "terrorists"... wink-wink).<br/><br/>In related news, a black body bag with the words "I'm Not Dead Yet" written on it in Persian has been spotted roaming the streets of Tehran. When asked for comment, Elton John simply said, "Well, I always knew my music would be good for something...even if it was just to distract people from the bodies."<br/><br/>The videos were posted by Vahid, a US-based Iranian social media influencer and activist (aka the guy who's been documenting everything on Instagram). He claims the footage was filmed by a brave soul who traveled nearly 1,000km to find internet access - mainly because they wanted to see if their WiFi signal would reach that far.<br/><br/>When asked about the graphic content of the videos, Vahid said, "Hey, someone's gotta document this stuff. Might as well be me...and Elton."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, experts have confirmed that the body bags in question are actually made of a special material that's 99% resistant to stains - although they're still not sure what happened to the other 1%.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story...or just keep scrolling through your Instagram feed.</p>
