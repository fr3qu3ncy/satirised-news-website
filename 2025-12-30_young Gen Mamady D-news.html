        <p>BREAKING: Social Media Meltdowns and Presidential Peculiarities Unfold<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the nation's social media platforms - TikTok, YouTube, and Facebook - have been shut down for reasons that can only be described as utterly absurd. As the country awaits the final result from the presidential poll, chaos has erupted, and our news team is on the ground to bring you the most ridiculous updates.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it's just a bunch of people standing around looking confused), the internet was restricted in an attempt to stifle criticism of the election results. Ah, but little did they know that this move would only serve to fuel the fire of memes and jokes about the junta leader's questionable fashion sense.<br/><br/>Gen Mamady Doumbouya, the junta chief who's been ruling Guinea with an iron fist since 2021, has taken a massive lead in the presidential election. His winning strategy? Apparently, it involves being popular among Guinea's youth while simultaneously restricting opposition activities and banning protests. Talk about a contradiction!<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Doumbouya, who's now aged 41 (but still rocking that youthful energy), broke his promise not to run for office by putting his name on the ballot. Who needs integrity when you can just ignore your promises and become president instead?<br/><br/>As news of the restricted social media spread, people took to... well, actually, they couldn't because social media was down! However, rumors have it that a group of rebels (not the junta kind, we hope) attempted to organize an impromptu protest by chanting slogans while simultaneously sipping on lukewarm cups of coffee. Alas, their efforts were thwarted when they realized they had forgotten their signs and placards at home.<br/><br/>In related news, a group of hipsters in Guinea decided to take advantage of the situation and start a petition to make " restricted social media" an official national holiday. Signatures are being collected (but not really, because who needs physical signatures anymore?) and the hashtag #RestrictedSocialMedia is trending on... oh wait, there's no internet.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems that Guinea has descended into complete chaos, with our news team struggling to keep up with the absurdity of it all. As we go to press (if you can even call it that), social media is still down, and Gen Doumbouya is... well, he's probably celebrating his victory while simultaneously planning his next move to restrict freedom.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story! Or don't, because who needs news when you have memes?</p>
