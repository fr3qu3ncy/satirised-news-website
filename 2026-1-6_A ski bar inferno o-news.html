    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Ski Bar Inferno Kills 40, Injures 116, and Makes Us Question Everything<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a fire at a ski bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, has left 40 people dead and 116 others injured. But don't worry, it's not just the usual "tragic accident" nonsense – oh no, this one has a dash of Spice Girls, a pinch of Netflix, and a whole lot of "what were they thinking?!"<br/><br/>According to sources (okay, fine, it was Nicolas Feraud, the mayor of Crans-Montana), the bar in question hadn't been inspected for safety checks since 2019. That's right, folks – five whole years without a visit from the local health and safety squad. We're pretty sure that's longer than some of us have had their Netflix subscription.<br/><br/>Now, we all know what happens when you don't check your soundproofing foam (it gets all, well, fiery), but seriously, who needs soundproofing foam on the ceiling of a bar? It's like putting a blanket over a disco ball and calling it a day. Just ask Jacques and Jessica Moretti, the French couple who managed Le Constellation – they're now under investigation for manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence, and arson by negligence (we're pretty sure that's just a fancy way of saying "what were you thinking?").<br/><br/>And if all this wasn't enough, there's been an eyewitness account from someone claiming to have seen partygoers using sparklers with champagne bottles in 2019. We repeat: SPARKLERS IN A BAR! It's like they wanted to create their own personal inferno, à la Katniss Everdeen ( minus the whole "trying not to get killed by a dictator" thing).<br/><br/>Now, as news of this tragedy spreads, people are taking to social media to express their shock and horror. But let's be real – we're all just secretly thinking, "Wait, what year is it again?" And don't even get us started on the fact that the mayor mentioned having a team of five people inspecting over 10,000 buildings in Crans-Montana. That's like trying to find a needle in a haystack, while blindfolded, and with a group of drunken accountants.<br/><br/>In conclusion, this whole debacle is just a big ol' mess – a bit like our lives after watching too much reality TV. So, let's all take a deep breath, put on some comfy PJs, and remind ourselves that, hey, at least we're not the ones responsible for inspecting soundproofing foam.<br/><br/>UPDATE: As news of this tragic event continues to unfold, officials have announced plans to ban sparklers in local venues. We repeat: SPARKLERS ARE BANNED! Don't try it at home, folks – we can only assume that's what the people who wrote the warning labels on the sparkler packaging were trying to say.<br/><br/>FINAL UPDATE: Crans-Montana officials have announced they will be bringing in an external contractor to inspect and audit all 128 venues in the area. And by "external contractor," we mean "someone with a good eye for safety, sanity, and possibly a PhD in physics."</p>
