        <p>BREAKING: Tehran says its armed forces are ready "with their fingers on the trigger" to respond to any aggression - and by 'aggression', we mean the impending arrival of a team of enthusiastic line-dancers from Florida<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Tehran has announced that its armed forces are poised to defend against a potential attack from... well, it's not entirely clear what or who, but we're going with "a horde of mariachi players on their way to perform at the annual Fajr Festival".<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Iranian government (okay, fine - it was just Ali Khamenei's cat), the country's military is bracing for impact from an army of sequined warriors armed with nothing but a fierce devotion to traditional Mexican music.<br/><br/>"We are ready to respond with force to any aggression," said Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi, brandishing a tiny sombrero and shouting "¡Viva la revolución!" as he addressed the press. "And by 'aggression', we mean those fiesty line-dancers from Florida - they're going to be a tough crowd, if you know what I mean."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Trump has weighed in on the situation via Twitter (because, of course), saying "Just got word that the US military is building up in the Gulf. Don't worry, folks - we've got this one covered... with a choreographed routine to 'YMCA'!"<br/><br/>The US Navy's flagship aircraft carrier, the USS Abraham Lincoln (which has apparently been replaced by an armada of dancing instructors), has reportedly been deployed to the region "to help keep things on beat".<br/><br/>As tensions escalate between Tehran and the line-dancing squad from Florida, the international community holds its breath in anticipation of... well, not exactly a war, but at least a spirited game of musical chairs.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story - or just watch some actual news.</p>
