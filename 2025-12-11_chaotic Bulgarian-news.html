        <p>Breaking News: Bulgarian PM Resigns, Country Descends into Chaos<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Bulgarian Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov has resigned amidst mass protests in the streets. The move comes as the country prepares to join the eurozone and just days before a vote of no confidence in parliament.<br/><br/>As protesters took to the streets, waving signs that read "Resignation! Mafia Out!" and shouting slogans like "Bulgaria is not for sale!", Zhelyazkov made a dramatic TV address from his bathtub, surrounded by champagne bottles and a mariachi band. "We hear the voice of citizens protesting against the government," he said, his hairpiece askew. "Both young and old have raised their voices for [our resignation], and we're like, 'Okay, cool, we'll just pack up our bags and go'."<br/><br/>The protests, which drew tens of thousands of people to the streets, were sparked by accusations of widespread corruption within Zhelyazkov's minority centre-right government. The government had already scrapped a controversial budget plan in response to the demonstrations last week.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Boyko Borissov was seen sneaking out of the country, dressed as a chicken, while oligarch Delyan Peevski was spotted trying to sell his private island on eBay for a "steal".<br/><br/>As the country descended into chaos, Bulgaria's President Rumen Radev was seen attempting to calm the situation by breaking out into an impromptu rendition of the cha-cha-slide. "Don't worry, citizens," he said, his arms waving wildly. "We'll get through this. We'll... uh... do some maths and stuff."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, a group of protesters was seen attempting to block a McDonald's restaurant in Sofia with a giant inflatable unicorn. When asked for comment, the CEO of McDonald's Bulgaria simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least it's not Burger King."<br/><br/>The situation remains fluid as this report goes to press. Stay tuned for further updates on the unfolding drama.<br/><br/>Meanwhile...<br/><br/>* A group of hipsters in Sofia were seen setting up a makeshift bar serving artisanal craft beer made from water they found in a puddle.<br/>* The Bulgarian national anthem was rewritten to include lyrics about pizza and how much people love it.<br/>* The country's top scientist, Dr. Ivan Ivanov, was seen frantically trying to invent a machine that turns thoughts into reality... or at least into a decent Wi-Fi signal.<br/><br/>And finally...<br/><br/>In related news, Bulgaria's new Prime Minister (who hasn't been elected yet) was spotted on social media promising to introduce a new national holiday: "National Day of Watching Cat Videos and Eating Nachos". When asked for comment, the PM-elect simply shrugged and said, "Hey, it's all about bringing people together, man."</p>
