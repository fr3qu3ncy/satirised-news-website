        <p>COMEDY NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>HEADLINE: Mike Huckabee Suggests Israel Can Take Over the Middle East, Because, You Know, God Said So (And Also Because He Really Loves Falafel)<br/><br/>SUBHEADLINE: US Ambassador to Israel, Mike Huckabee, told Tucker Carlson that taking over the Middle East would be "fine" and that he's pretty sure God would approve of it. Meanwhile, Arab governments are like, "Uh no, dude."<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Mike Huckabee, the US Ambassador to Israel, suggested in an interview with Tucker Carlson that Israel could take over the entire Middle East because, well, God said so. Because, you know, God is always right and all (except when he says things like "Thou shalt not covet thy neighbor's wife," which clearly doesn't apply to Mike Huckabee).<br/><br/>Huckabee explained that while he doesn't actually think Israel should take over the entire Middle East (because, let's be real, that would be super inconvenient for everyone), God did say they could have it all in the Bible. And who are we to argue with God? I mean, except for the part where he also said slavery is okay and that women shouldn't be able to vote... but let's not get bogged down in details.<br/><br/>The interview quickly took a turn for the absurd when Carlson pressed Huckabee on his interpretation of a specific Bible verse. Huckabee responded by saying it would be a "big piece of land," which, let's be honest, is like the understatement of the century. I mean, come on, dude, you're talking about taking over an entire region!<br/><br/>The Arab governments were not having it, though. In a joint statement, they condemned Huckabee's comments as "dangerous and inflammatory" and said they would totally disrupt efforts to end the war in Gaza. Who knew the Middle East was just one big game of Risk?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was all like, "Uh, yeah, we've been doing this for years, and it's totally not a problem." And Mike Huckabee was all like, "Yeah, I know, right? God said so!"<br/><br/>FACTS YOU SHOULD KNOW:<br/><br/>* The US Ambassador to Israel is kind of like the principal of the Middle East school playground.<br/>* God is still really cool with people taking over other countries and ruling them with an iron fist (just ask Mike Huckabee).<br/>* Falafel is a delicious Middle Eastern food that everyone loves, even if they're not from there.<br/><br/>RELATED STORIES:<br/><br/>* "Arab Governments Condemn US Ambassador's Comments as 'Dangerous and Inflammatory'"<br/>* "Mike Huckabee Defends His Right to Wear a Yarmulke While Eating Falafel"<br/>* "Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu Releases Statement Saying, 'I'm Not an Occupier, I'm Just a Nice Guy Who Loves Falafel'"<br/><br/>COMING SOON:<br/><br/>* "Mike Huckabee Announces He Will Be Running for President on the Platform of Taking Over the Middle East and Bringinging Falafel to Everyone"</p>
