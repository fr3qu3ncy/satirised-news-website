    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Matthew Perry's Death Spun Out of Control Like a Vegas Roulette Wheel<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Dr Mark Chavez, a San Diego-based physician with a questionable habit of handing out ketamine like candy, has been sentenced to eight months of home detention. Yeah, you read that right - eight whole months in the comfort of his own home, where he can binge-watch Netflix and play video games all day long.<br/><br/>This guy's involvement in Matthew Perry's death is just a minor blip on the radar of his life. I mean, who needs a medical license when you've got a prescription pad and a wholesale distributor at your fingertips? Chavez's plea agreement was like reading a recipe for disaster - he admitted to obtaining ketamine from his clinic and a wholesaler through a fake prescription, and then sold it to Dr Salvador Plasencia, the guy who supplied the anaesthetic to Matthew Perry.<br/><br/>And let me tell you, this Plasencia dude is like the ultimate enabler. He's got a history of exploiting people with addiction issues for financial gain - I mean, who wouldn't want to make some cash off of someone's substance abuse? He even had the audacity to text Chavez, "I wonder how much this moron will pay." Yeah, because that's not a red flag at all.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Matthew Perry's friends are still reeling from his death. They're like, "Matthew was struggling with addiction and depression, but we never thought it would get this bad." Um, didn't you guys see the warning signs? The guy had a prescription for ketamine, which is basically just a fancy word for "party favort"! <br/><br/>And then there's Erik Fleming, Matthew Perry's live-in assistant, who was involved in the whole shebang. I mean, what's the deal with that guy? Was he just trying to get in on the action and make some quick cash off of his celebrity boss?<br/><br/>As for Jasveen Sangha, the "Ketamine Queen," she's like the ultimate mastermind behind this whole operation. I mean, who needs a medical license when you've got a dealer with a flair for drama? She's got a reputation for being ruthless in her business dealings - just ask any of the other dealers on the block.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Matthew Perry's death was not just a tragic accident; it was a result of a whole chain reaction of events that went horribly wrong. And Dr Mark Chavez's sentencing is just a minor slap on the wrist compared to the magnitude of this entire debacle.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The FBI has launched an investigation into the matter and has confiscated all of Chavez's video game consoles, including his prized PlayStation 5.</p>
