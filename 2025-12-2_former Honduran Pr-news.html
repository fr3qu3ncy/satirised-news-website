        <p>BREAKING: Former Honduran President, Juan Orlando Hernández, Walks Free After Being Pardoned by Trump for His Role in the Largest Cocaine Smuggling Operation in US History<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former Honduran President Juan Orlando Hernández has been released from prison after being pardoned by Donald Trump for his involvement in the largest cocaine smuggling operation in US history. Yes, you read that right - 400 TONNES OF COCAINE. That's like filling up the entire stadium at WrestleMania with a mountain of white powder.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Hernández was not only involved in the smuggling operation but also received a $1 million bribe from Joaquín "El Chapo" Guzmán to secure his presidential campaign. Who knew that running for president could be so lucrative? I mean, who needs a salary when you can just smuggle cocaine and get paid?<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Hernández's brother, Juan Antonio "Tony" Hernández, was also involved in the smuggling operation and received a life sentence in prison. You'd think that would be enough to keep the whole family out of trouble, but nope - not when you have a Trump pardon on your side.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Trump administration, Hernández's pardon was a "Biden setup" designed to distract from the real issue at hand: Trump's love of Honduran presidential candidates. That's right, folks - Trump has endorsed Tito Asfura for president of Honduras in the upcoming election, because what could possibly go wrong with that?<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking - "But what about the 400 tonnes of cocaine?" Well, let me tell you, it's all been taken care of. The DEA has issued a statement saying that they'll just have to get in line behind Trump's lawyers to get any questions answered.<br/><br/>In related news, Michael Shifter, an adjunct professor at Georgetown University, has come out and said that he's "puzzled" by the pardon, mainly because it contradicts Trump's declared policy of clamping down on drug trafficking. Who knew that Trump was actually a fan of lax law enforcement?<br/><br/>So there you have it - another example of Trump's commitment to doing whatever it takes to keep his friends and donors happy, even if it means pardoning someone for their role in one of the largest cocaine smuggling operations in US history.<br/><br/>UPDATE: If you're still confused about what just happened, don't worry - I am too. But hey, at least we can all agree that this is one heck of a way to spend your Tuesday afternoon.</p>
