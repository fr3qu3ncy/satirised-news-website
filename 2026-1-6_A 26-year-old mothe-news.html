        <p>Breaking News: Indian Gang Rape Survivor Spends Christmas with the Chipmunks<br/><br/>DELHI, INDIA - In a bizarre turn of events, the 26-year-old mother-of-two who was gang-raped by two men in an ambulance (because, why not?) has been discharged from hospital after a week-long stay. And just to make things more interesting, she spent Christmas with none other than Alvin and the Chipmunks.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the hospital, the survivor was visited by Dave Seville (yes, that Dave Seville) and his furry friends on Christmas Eve, where they sang a rousing chorus of "The Chipmunk Song (Christmas Don't Be Late)" while she lay in bed with multiple fractures and serious head injuries. When asked about the impromptu visit, a hospital spokesperson said, "Well, we figured it was either that or a visit from the Ghosts of Christmas Past, Present, and Future - and let's be real, who doesn't want to spend the holiday season with singing rodents?"<br/><br/>As for the rapists, they're still in custody and facing charges of attempted murder (because, you know, attempted rape wasn't enough). The police are confident that they'll get a conviction, mostly because they have a solid alibi: "We were just trying to get home from the Christmas party early so we could watch the game."<br/><br/>In other news, the Indian government has announced plans to introduce new anti-rape laws that include mandatory appearances by rapists on episodes of "The Great British Baking Show." The law is aimed at reducing the number of rapes in India, which currently stands at a whopping 29,670 per year (mostly because everyone loves a good bake-off).<br/><br/>In related news, Bollywood star Ranveer Singh has announced that he's changing his name to Ranveer Singh Chipmunk and will be starring in an upcoming film about... you guessed it: the adventures of Alvin and the Chipmunks. When asked for comment, he said, "I'm not sure what's more exciting - my new career as a chipmunk or my old one as an actor."<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, the survivor has announced that she'll be writing her own autobiography, titled "Gang-Raped and Still Standing (with Multiple Fractures)". When asked about the title, she said, "I figure if I can survive being gang-raped by two men in an ambulance, I can definitely write a bestselling book about it."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
