        <p>BREAKING: Drone Strikes on Kindergarten, 50 People Dead, Including 33 Children... and a Few Other Unrelated Things<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a drone attack on the town of Kalogi in Sudan's South Kordofan region has left at least 50 people dead, including 33 children. But wait, it gets even better! The attack also resulted in the death of 7 accountants who were just trying to do their job, and 10 chickens who were in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>The Rapid Support Forces (RSF), a paramilitary group battling the army in Sudan's civil war, was accused of Thursday's attack by a medical organization, the Sudan Doctors' Network, and the army. However, when reached for comment, an RSF spokesperson said, "Sorry, we're busy watching Netflix right now, can't talk about it." The army also had no immediate comment, but sources close to them say they were too busy arguing with their spouses to care.<br/><br/>The attack on the kindergarten was said to have been carried out by a group of rogue drones who had grown tired of playing Fortnite and decided to get into some real-life action. "It's like they wanted to level up in the game of war," said an eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous because he didn't want his name associated with this whole mess.<br/><br/>The UN children's agency Unicef responded to reports of the attack by saying, "Killing children in their school is a horrific violation of children's rights... and also a really bad idea." The agency urged all parties to stop these attacks immediately and allow safe, unhindered access for humanitarian assistance to reach those in desperate need... or at least get them some decent snacks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a related story, the Kenyan government has announced that it will be sending a team of superheroes, known as "The Avengers of Africa," to Sudan to deal with the situation. The team includes Spider-Man (from Kenya), Captain America (from Ghana), and Black Panther (who is actually just a rich guy from South Africa).<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, it was reported that SpongeBob SquarePants, the popular cartoon character, had been spotted in Kalogi, sipping on a Krabby Patty-flavored smoothie. When asked for comment, he simply said, "I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready..." to go back to Bikini Bottom.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story... or not. We'll be here, eating our lunch and watching cat videos.</p>
