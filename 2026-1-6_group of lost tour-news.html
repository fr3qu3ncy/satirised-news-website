        <p>BREAKING: "Operation Madura" - US Military's Latest Operation... Sort Of<br/><br/>Caracas, Venezuela - In a shocking turn of events, the US military has launched an operation in Caracas, but it's not quite what you'd expect. According to sources, the "operation" consists of a group of confused tourists trying to find their way back to the airport.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get to the beach," said one tourist, who wished to remain anonymous. "I had no idea there were 'military operations' going on in this city."<br/><br/>The US military's involvement is reportedly limited to a few soldiers wearing funny hats and holding signs that read "Lost Tourists Welcome".<br/><br/>"It seems unjust to me," said another tourist, who was overheard complaining about the lack of decent coffee shops in Caracas. "We just want to get back to our all-inclusive resorts and enjoy some bottomless margaritas."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Nicolas Maduro has issued a statement condemning the US military's actions as an "unprovoked attack on our city's caffeine supply".<br/><br/>"We will not stand idly by while the US military disrupts our coffee breaks," said Maduro. "We will fight back with every last ounce of our sugary energy drinks."<br/><br/>Skydiver Crashes into Traffic Light, But That's Not Related<br/><br/>In unrelated news, a skydiver crashed into a traffic light in Mexico City yesterday, but thankfully escaped without injury.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get some Instagram-worthy shots," said the skydiver. "I didn't mean to land on top of that traffic light."<br/><br/>US Military Operation... Maybe? Possibly?<br/><br/>As for the US military operation in Caracas, sources close to the matter claim it's still ongoing, but with a twist.<br/><br/>"We're not really sure what we're doing," said one soldier, who wished to remain anonymous. "We were just told to 'do something' and now we're all confused."<br/><br/>Red Cross Worker Interviewsed by BBC (Again)<br/><br/>In a separate story, the BBC's Nada Tawfik was seen interviewing a Red Cross worker for what seems like the hundredth time this week.<br/><br/>"I'm just trying to get some quotes for our next news segment," said Tawfik. "I promise I'll ask different questions this time."<br/><br/>Jamaica's Ground Zero: Hurricane Melissa Edition<br/><br/>In other news, Jamaica is still recovering from the devastating effects of Hurricane Melissa, which left a trail of destruction in its wake.<br/><br/>"It's like nothing we've ever seen before," said one resident. "Except for that one time when the Jamaican football team lost to Brazil."<br/><br/>Local Police Say Skydiver Not Injured (Sort Of)<br/><br/>And finally, local police in Mexico City confirmed that the skydiver who crashed into a traffic light yesterday was not injured... but only because they were too busy watching cat videos on their phones.<br/><br/>"We're really sorry about that," said one officer. "But honestly, it's hard to focus when there are so many cute cats out there."</p>
