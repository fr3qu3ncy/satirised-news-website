        <p>BREAKING: BONDI BEACH SHOOTING TURNS INTO WORST NIGHTMARE FOR JEWISH COMMUNITY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, 11 people were killed in a shooting at Bondi Beach targeting the Jewish community. But that's not all - one gunman was also killed, and another was taken into custody by police. Because, you know, two shooters just isn't enough.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses reported seeing a man wrestling with one of the gunmen before disarming him. We can only assume this hero is now being considered for a Nobel Peace Prize... or at least a free pass to the next Jewish deli night.<br/><br/>Police Commissioner Chris Minns held a press conference, where he announced that they had "no idea" who was behind the attack. Because, you know, it's not like they have surveillance footage or witnesses. Nope, this one is definitely going to be solved in about 10 minutes... after a few cups of coffee.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Bondi Beach was closed due to " unforeseen circumstances". Which, let's be real, just means someone forgot to put out the trash.<br/><br/>And because why not, a group of tourists were spotted doing a rendition of the cha cha slide on top of a shark tank. Because, priorities.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Reports are coming in that the shooter was a disgruntled former employee of the Bondi Beach cafe where they served only one kind of coffee - and it wasn't even a good kind.</p>
