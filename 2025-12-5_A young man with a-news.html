        <p>A Virginia man named Brian Cole Jr. allegedly planted pipe bombs outside US national committee buildings, only to have his own life unravel in a series of laughably inept and absurd events.</p>

        <p>Breaking News: Pipe Bomb Plot Unravels, and So Does the Suspect's Sanity<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the FBI has finally cracked the case of the pipe bombs placed outside the Republican and Democratic national committees on the eve of the 2021 Capitol riot. And by "bizarre," I mean utterly ridiculous.<br/><br/>Meet Brian Cole Jr., the 30-year-old Virginia man who allegedly planted the devices, which were safely deactivated without exploding. Because, you know, that's exactly what you want to happen when trying to blow something up – a complete and utter flop.<br/><br/>Cole's alleged motive? Who knows? Maybe he just wanted to get on the news with his "I'm-a-malicious-bomber-but-not-really" face. His defense team will probably argue that he was just trying to... um, redecorate the DNC building with some nice, shiny pipe bombs.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Investigators discovered that Cole purchased bomb-making components at Home Depot and Lowes hardware stores, which means he's basically a modern-day MacGyver – minus the charm and charisma. Oh, and get this: his car was seen by a license plate reader less than half a mile from the location where the devices were planted. What are the chances? It's like he had a GPS system or something (which, spoiler alert, he probably did).<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the pièce de résistance – Cole's shoes. Yes, you read that right. The FBI discovered thousands of pairs of Nike Air Max Speed Turfs were distributed through more than two dozen retailers. Because, clearly, this is what America was missing: a shoe conspiracy theory.<br/><br/>US Attorney General Pam Bondi said Cole was arrested without incident early on Thursday morning. I'm sure it had nothing to do with the fact that he was wearing his lucky Nike Air Max Speed Turfs at the time of his arrest.<br/><br/>FBI Director Kash Patel claimed that attacking American citizens is like, you know, a really bad idea. Who knew? Meanwhile, FBI Deputy Director Dan Bongino said people can't just walk into our capital city, plant devices, and "walk off into the sunset." Oh no, because that would be far too convenient.<br/><br/>In related news, Donald Trump has announced his candidacy for President in 2028 – on his trusty iPhone 12 Pro Max, which was incidentally purchased at a Walmart store near Cole's house. Coincidence? I think not!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this utterly ridiculous story!</p>
