        <p>JAPAN'S PARLIAMENT BUILDING: A CLOSET FOR MEN, BUT NOT LADIES<br/><br/>In a shocking revelation, Japan's parliament building has been found to have more toilets for men than women. Yes, you read that right! The very same building where the country's leaders decide the fate of its citizens has a whopping 12 men's toilets with 67 stalls and urinals, but only one female toilet with two cubicles near the plenary chamber.<br/><br/>It's like they say: "A man's gotta go, but not necessarily on the ladies' side." The Prime Minister, Sanae Takaichi, who became Japan's first female leader last year, is now leading the charge for more female toilets in parliament. She's joined by 58 other women MPs who signed a petition to make the parliament building a more inclusive space for all.<br/><br/>But why stop at just one toilet? "We want to raise our voice and prepare ourselves for the day when women hold more than 30% of parliamentary seats," said Yasuko Komiyama, an opposition lawmaker. Yeah, because having two toilets for every 58 women is totally not a problem.<br/><br/>The parliament building was built in 1936, a decade before women were given the right to vote in 1945. Talk about timing! It's like they planned it that way: "Hey, let's build a parliament with more men's toilets than women's, and then we'll give them the right to vote just so they can make the same crappy decisions!"<br/><br/>In all seriousness, Japan has made significant progress in promoting women's empowerment, but this issue highlights the need for more inclusivity in the country's institutions. Who knew that something as mundane as a toilet could become a feminist cause célèbre?<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Prime Minister has announced plans to add more female toilets to the parliament building, citing the need for "more peace of mind" for women lawmakers. We're not sure what's more astonishing: the fact that they're finally addressing this issue or that they're using a 5-year-old's phrase to justify it.<br/><br/>In related news, we've learned that the Japanese government has set a target of having 30% of leadership roles held by women... in 2030. Yeah, because that's not too late to start working on it, right?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, former Prime Minister Shigeru Ishiba has promised to "enhance women's restroom facilities" nationwide. Because, you know, the ladies just can't seem to get a decent pee in Japan.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the land of rising toilets!</p>
