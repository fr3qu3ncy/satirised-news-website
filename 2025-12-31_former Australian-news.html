        <p>Former Australia batter Damien Martyn, 54, who played 67 Test matches, is in an induced coma in a Queensland hospital after being diagnosed with meningitis. But here's the thing...<br/><br/>As it turns out, Damien Martyn was on his way to become the world's greatest pizza chef when suddenly, BAM! Meningitis struck him down like a cricket ball to the chest (pun intended). His love for cooking was only rivaled by his love for playing cricket, and now he's stuck in a hospital with nothing but a bag of ice packs and a bunch of nurses who can't even tell the difference between a left-hander and a right-hander.<br/><br/>Martyn's partner Amanda is beside herself, wondering how her beloved Damien could have fallen ill on Boxing Day (of all days!). "I just want him to wake up and tell me he's still got that killer instinct when it comes to scoring runs," she said, tears streaming down her face. "And can someone please turn off the Christmas lights in his room? They're giving me a headache."<br/><br/>Close friend and former Australia team-mate Adam Gilchrist (no relation to the Adam Gilchrist who's secretly training for the next season of The Bachelor) confirmed that Martyn is receiving treatment in hospital, but only after he finished his daily dose of Netflix-binging. "We're all rooting for him," said Gilchrist. "And by 'we', I mean everyone except the doctors, who are just trying to figure out how to get Damien to stop yelling at them through the ventilator."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, former Australian Rules football star Brad Hardie is leading a campaign to get Martyn's favorite food – chicken parma – delivered to his hospital room. "It's the least we can do for this cricket legend," said Hardie. "Besides, it's not like he's going to win any more Test matches... err, I mean, eat any more pizzas."<br/><br/>Northamptonshire head coach Darren Lehmann (who's secretly trying out for The Great British Baking Show) sent his best wishes via Twitter, saying: "Lots of love and prayers... Keep strong and fighting legend... And can someone please get him a decent cuppa?"<br/><br/>During his career, Martyn scored 4,406 Test runs at an average of 46.37 (no, that's not his IQ – but wouldn't it be funny if it was?). He was also known for his ability to eat an entire pizza by himself while watching the cricket on TV. When asked about his favorite team, he'd always say: "The one with the most pizzas in the break room."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on Damien Martyn's condition... and don't forget to send your favorite snack (preferably not a chicken parma) to the hospital – it'll surely bring him back from the brink of oblivion!</p>
