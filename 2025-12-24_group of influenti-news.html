        <p>BREAKING: Trump Administration Bans People Who Want to Regulate Tech, Replaces Them with Kardashians<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the Trump administration has banned five people who have called for tech regulation from entering the country. But in a twist, they've replaced them with a new list of approved individuals - and it's all about the 'gram.<br/><br/>Clare Melford, CEO of the Global Disinformation Index (GDI), and Imran Ahmed, ex-Labour adviser turned Centre for Countering Digital Hate (CCDH) head, were labelled "radical activists" by the Trump administration and banned from entering the US. But little do they know, they've been replaced by the one person who knows a thing or two about radical activism - Kylie Jenner.<br/><br/>That's right, folks! The new list of approved individuals includes none other than Kylie, Kim, Kourtney, Khloe, and Kris - the Kardashian clan themselves. Who better to regulate tech than the Queen of Social Media herself?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Trump administration (okay, it was just me), the reason for this sudden change is simple: "We need someone who knows how to make a viral video about regulating tech." And let's be real, the Kardashians have perfected that art form.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, European leaders are up in arms over the ban. French President Emmanuel Macron called it "intimidation and coercion aimed at undermining European digital sovereignty," while the EU's foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas said it was "unacceptable and an attempt to challenge our sovereignty." Um, yeah, good luck with that, guys.<br/><br/>But don't worry, I've got a solution. I'm starting a petition (which will definitely go viral on social media) to let Clare Melford and Imran Ahmed back into the country - just as soon as they agree to do a collab video with Kylie Jenner about regulating tech.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* "Kardashians Take Over Tech Regulation" <br/>* "Clare Melford and Imran Ahmed Banned from US, Replaced by Kardashians"<br/>* "US Bans People Who Want to Regulate Tech, Introduces 'Influencer' Visa Program"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story - or should I say, this Kardashian-filled drama?</p>
