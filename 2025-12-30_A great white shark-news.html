        <h2>SHARK-GATE SCANDAL ROCKS MEDITERRANEAN - 40 GREAT WHITES KILLED IN NORTH AFRICA!</h2>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>The Mediterranean Sea is rocked by a scandal known as Shark-Gate, in which great white sharks are being overfished and killed, despite international protection laws, because who needs laws when you've got a fishing industry to take care of?</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>SHARK-GATE SCANDAL ROCKS MEDITERRANEAN<br/><br/>In a shocking revelation, researchers have discovered that great white sharks in the Mediterranean Sea are facing extinction due to overfishing and illegal fishing. But that's not all - it gets even juicier!<br/><br/>According to sources (okay, fine, it was just some random guy on Twitter), at least 40 great white sharks have been killed in North African fish markets alone. That's like, a whole season of Shark Tank, but with more fins and less suits.<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "But wait, aren't great whites protected by international law?" And to that, we say... well, yes! But who needs laws when you've got a good ol' fashioned fishing industry to take care of? It's like the saying goes: "You can't make a omelette without breaking some eggs... and also killing a few sharks."<br/><br/>The researchers behind this groundbreaking study (which we're pretty sure was conducted by a team of marine biologists, a couple of accountants, and a guy named Dave who just really loves sharks) claim that the Mediterranean white shark population is now critically endangered. Who knew? We thought it was just a bunch of old guys in speedos trying to catch some rays.<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! The researchers are on top of this shark-gate scandal like a plate of anchovies at a seafood buffet. They're working with their North African colleagues to monitor fishing ports and catch any sharks that might be trying to sell their fins online (because, you know, there's always someone willing to make a buck off a poor, defenseless fish).<br/><br/>And if you're wondering what happens to all those dead sharks... well, let's just say they're not exactly making a splash on the local seafood menu. More like a big ol' splat.<br/><br/>SPECIAL REPORT<br/><br/>We managed to get our hands on some exclusive footage (which we're pretty sure was shot by a drone with a built-in selfie stick) of researchers trying to catch a great white shark in the Mediterranean. The footage, which we're calling "Shark-Fail," shows the team baiting the ocean with tuna scraps and whatnot, only to come up empty-handed. Well, except for that one time they saw a blue shark on their submarine cameras... but let's not get too excited here.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>We've just received word from our top (okay, fine, it was just some intern) source that the researchers have caught a break in the case of the missing sharks! It turns out that one of the fishing boats involved in the shark-gate scandal was actually owned by a certain Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. We're not kidding - the guy's got more fish-related business ventures than you can shake a stick at.<br/><br/>When reached for comment, The Rock simply shrugged and said, "Can you smell what the Rock is cooking?" to which we responded with a hearty "uh, no, actually we're still trying to figure out what this whole shark-gate thing means."<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! This story's just getting started... or should we say, fin-tastic?</p>
