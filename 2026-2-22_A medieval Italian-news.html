        <p>The Bones of St Francis of Assisi Go On Public Display... Sort Of<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the remains of Italy's patron saint, St Francis of Assisi, have been displayed to the public for the first time in history. Or at least, that's what they want you to think.<br/><br/>Apparently, the 13th-century skeleton has only been seen by about 400,000 people from around the world who reserved a spot to see it. But let's be real, those tickets were probably bought up by a bunch of rowdy Italian tourists looking for a free pass to grab some gelato and take a selfie with a dead guy.<br/><br/>The display is taking place in a nitrogen-filled plexiglass case at the lower church of Assisi's basilica, which sounds like a fancy way of saying "a big glass box that smells like freezer burn." We're told that St Francis' remains have only been seen in public once before – for one day in 1978 to a very limited group of people. But we all know what really happened: it was just a bunch of monks trying to get out of their monastery duties and do some extreme ironing.<br/><br/>St Francis is, of course, one of the most venerated figures in Christianity, which is code for "he's really good at begging for scraps." He renounced his wealth (because who needs that, anyway?) and devoted his life to the poor, founding the order of the Franciscans. And by "poor," we mean the kind of people who would actually eat a stale bread crust.<br/><br/>The Feast of St Francis is celebrated annually on 4 October to mark the day of his death in 1226, which is also known as "the day when Italy finally got its act together and started making some decent pasta sauces." Little-known fact: St Francis was also the patron saint of animals... and by "animals," we mean cats who like to sleep on your lap.<br/><br/>The late Pope Francis (RIP) chose his name after the radical humility of Saint Francis, which is code for "he really liked wearing funny hats." And now, the world gets to see St Francis' bones until March 22nd. That's right, folks – just enough time to get that Instagram selfie and then promptly forget about him again.<br/><br/>In related news: The BBC has learned that St Francis' tomb has been restored and is now open for business... or at least, it would be if they sold tickets to see the bones. But don't worry, we're sure it's just a coincidence that the same day as the display, Italian toddler dies after transplant with heart 'burned by frostbite.'</p>
