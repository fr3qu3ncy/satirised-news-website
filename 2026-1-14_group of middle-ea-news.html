        <p>BREAKING: Gaza Peace Plan 2.0, Because Phase One Was So Last Season<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US has launched Phase Two of its Gaza peace plan, because who needs a functioning government when you can have a technocratic one? According to Steve Witkoff, US envoy and self-proclaimed Kingmaker, this new phase will bring demilitarisation, reconstruction, and a dash of magic dust to the beleaguered territory.<br/><br/>Witkoff announced that Hamas has agreed to give up its weapons without demanding an independent Palestinian state, mainly because they're tired of being asked for their guns every five minutes. Israel, on the other hand, is thrilled to have a new excuse to put off rebuilding Gaza. "Hey, we can't just leave now – we need to fix the walls first!" said Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The technocratic Palestinian government will be led by Ali Shaath, a former deputy planning minister in the PA, who is basically the Gaza version of Mr. Bean. Nickolay Mladenov, a Bulgarian politician and former UN Middle East envoy, has been appointed as the representative on the ground in Gaza. Because what this conflict really needed was another European guy telling everyone to calm down.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hamas and its ally Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ) have agreed to support the efforts to form the technocratic government, mainly because they're too busy arguing over who ate the last falafel in the office fridge. The PA has also expressed support, because what's a little bit of infighting between rival factions when there are more important things to worry about?<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, Itzik and Talik Gvili, the parents of dead Israeli hostage Ran Gvili, were told by Netanyahu that their son's return is "a top priority" – mainly because it's been two years since they last heard from him. The Hostages and Missing Families Forum has responded with a passionate plea: "There is no phase 2 while Ran Gvili in Gaza. Phase Rani must come first!" (Because, you know, it's not like there are more pressing issues in the conflict).<br/><br/>In related news, the Israeli government has accused Hamas of deliberately delaying the recovery of Ran Gvili's remains – mainly because they're too busy arguing over who gets to keep his old iPhone. The US has promised to deploy an International Stabilisation Force (ISF) to train and support vetted Palestinian police forces, mostly so they can learn how to do a proper selfie with Trump.<br/><br/>As one wise observer noted: "Phase Two is like the sequel to a movie that never happened – it's just more of the same old stuff."</p>
