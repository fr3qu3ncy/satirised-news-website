        <p>LIBYA'S ARMY CHIEF KILLED IN AIR CRASH - BUT DON'T WORRY, IT WAS JUST A TURKISH TRAGEDY... WITH A SIDE OF MEL Brooks<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Libya's army chief, Gen Mohammed Ali Ahmed al-Haddad, was killed in an air crash in Turkey. But don't worry, it wasn't just a tragic accident - it was also a great excuse to get some free snacks on the plane.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the jet took off from Ankara with Gen Haddad and four other military officials on board. And by "eyewitnesses", I mean the in-flight movie crew who were there to film the making of the latest blockbuster hit - "Turkish Delight 2: The Sequel".<br/><br/>The plane was a Falcon 50 aircraft, which is like a Boeing 737 but with more... um... falcon-ness. It's like when you're at the grocery store and you buy a carton of eggs, but instead of just being eggs, they're also FALCON EGGS.<br/><br/>Anyway, the signal was lost about 42 minutes after takeoff, which is roughly the same amount of time it takes to watch an entire season of "The Great British Baking Show". The crew tried to make an emergency landing, but it was too late. The plane crashed into a nearby village, causing chaos and destruction - much like when you try to cook a frozen pizza in the microwave for 10 seconds too long.<br/><br/>Turkish Interior Minister Ali Yerlikaya said, "The investigation is ongoing, but I can confirm that there were no survivors. And by 'no survivors', I mean none of the people on the plane survived. But hey, at least the snacks were great!"<br/><br/>Libya's Prime Minister Abdul Hamid Dbeibeh was quick to respond, saying, "This is a great loss for our nation. We've lost men who served their country with sincerity and dedication... to get to the buffet table first."<br/><br/>And in other news, the Libyan government has announced plans to introduce a new national holiday - "Air Crash Day". It's like Christmas but with more... air crashes.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. Just another day in Turkey where people die in plane crashes and everyone gets free snacks.<br/><br/>related stories<br/><br/>* "MUM-OF-TWO DIED AFTER COSMETIC SURGERY IN TURKEY"... AND SO DID THE PLASTIC SURGEON'S CREDIT SCORE<br/>* "TURKISH CAR FERRY DAMAGED IN STRIKE AT UKRAINIAN PORT"... BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S JUST A HITCH IN THE GLOBAL SUPPLY CHAIN<br/>* "BUSIEST EVER CHRISTMAS EVE FOR AIR TRAVEL"... AND BY 'AIR TRAVEL', I MEAN THE NUMBER OF PLANES THAT CRASHED ON CHRISTMAS EVE</p>
