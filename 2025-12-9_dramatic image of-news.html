        <p>BREAKING: SUDAN AIR FORCE BOMBS TOWNS, MARKETS, AND SCHOOLS (AND ALMOST KILLS MICHAEL JACKSON)<br/><br/>A shocking report has emerged from Sudan's air force, which has been carrying out bombings in residential neighborhoods, markets, schools, and camps for displaced people. The investigation by the Sudan Witness Project reveals that at least 1,700 civilians have died in these attacks, with many more injured. But wait, it gets worse! Our sources close to the project reveal that Michael Jackson's ghost was nearly killed in one of these airstrikes.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, MJ's spirit was seen dancing down a street when suddenly, a bomb dropped from the sky and exploded mere feet away from him. "It was like he just disappeared into thin air," said an onlooker. "I mean, I've seen some weird stuff in Sudan, but this was something else."<br/><br/>The report also highlights the use of unguided bombs by the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF), which is being led by a certain General Gordon Ramsay. Yes, that's right – the fiery chef has traded his kitchen for a military uniform and is now using his culinary expertise to create the perfect aerial attacks.<br/><br/>"We're not just bombing civilians, we're serving them with a side of destruction," said General Ramsay in a statement. "And let me tell you, our bombs are so good that they'll make your taste buds dance."<br/><br/>The investigation also reveals that the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been using drones to attack military targets. However, their ineptitude has led to several cases of drone strikes hitting innocent civilians, including a group of tourists who were on a sightseeing tour in Darfur.<br/><br/>"We thought we were going to see some amazing sights," said one tourist. "But instead, we just got blown up by a drone."<br/><br/>The Sudan Witness Project's Mark Snoeck says that the SAF should also be held accountable for their actions, adding, "We're not saying they're as bad as the RSF, but they're definitely up there in terms of awfulness."<br/><br/>UPDATE: The RSF has responded to the report, saying that they are not responsible for the drone strikes and that it was actually a group of drunken elephants who were operating the drones. We await further clarification on this matter.<br/><br/>In related news, the United States has condemned the SAF's actions, with President Joe Biden stating, "We're not just condemning their actions, we're also putting them on a no-fly list. And trust us, that's going to be a real problem for them."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the British government has announced plans to provide additional funding to the Sudan Witness Project, saying, "We're committed to supporting initiatives that expose human rights violations and bring attention to the suffering of civilians in conflict zones."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
