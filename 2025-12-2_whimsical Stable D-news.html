        <p>BREAKING: Pope Leo XIV Demands Justice for Beirut Port Blast Victims, But First, Can Someone Please Pass the Wi-Fi Password?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Pope Leo XIV descended upon Lebanon like a divine Netflix binge-watcher, demanding justice for the 218 victims of the Beirut port blast. But first, he stopped to take a selfie with the Hezbollah militia and a pack of McDonald's fries.<br/><br/>As he wrapped up his three-day visit to the war-torn country, the Pontiff prayed at the site of the massive explosion, which was only made possible by the incompetence of Lebanese officials and the utter chaos that is Middle Eastern politics. It's like trying to find a functioning Wi-Fi network in a crowded Starbucks – it just ain't happening.<br/><br/>"I am deeply moved by my visit to the port," said Pope Leo XIV, sporting a stylish pair of Gucci sunglasses. "And also by the fact that I finally got some decent coffee at this Beirut café. It's like they knew I was coming!"<br/><br/>Victims' relatives and activists have been clamoring for justice since 2020, but it seems like the Lebanese government is more concerned with hosting a Beyoncé concert than actually taking responsibility for the disaster. Talk about priorities!<br/><br/>Cecile Roukoz, whose brother Joseph was killed in the blast, said: "We need justice for our brothers and all the victims of this explosion." Meanwhile, Tatiana Hasrouty, who lost her father Ghassan in the blast, added: "And also can someone please tell us where we can find some decent Wi-Fi around here? We've got a Netflix show to finish!"<br/><br/>As the Pope celebrated his final Mass on Beirut's waterfront – which was attended by an estimated 150,000 people, or roughly the entire population of North Korea – he called for unity among Lebanon's diverse communities. But first, he stopped to take a photo with a giant inflatable unicorn and a bunch of giggling children.<br/><br/>"Let us cast off the armour of our ethnic and political divisions," said Pope Leo XIV, "and reawaken in our hearts the dream of a united Lebanon... where we can all just get along and enjoy some nice falafel together."<br/><br/>In related news, Pope Leo XIV has been spotted wearing a 'Make Lebanon Great Again' hat on his travels. When asked about it, he simply said: "Hey, someone's got to promote this country – might as well be me!"<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Vatican has since issued a statement saying that the Pope was just joking about the hat and actually supports making Lebanon great through genuine efforts towards unity and justice. Or at least, that's what they're claiming.</p>
