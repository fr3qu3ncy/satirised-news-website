        <p>Breaking News: Teenagers Involved in Drug Trade Quadruple in 8 Years, But Who Cares?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the government has announced that the number of teenagers involved in the drugs trade has quadrupled in eight years. But don't worry, it's not like they're taking over the world or anything... oh wait, maybe they are.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (i.e., The Immortal, a Marseille gang member with a penchant for wearing bandages on his forehead), the teenage drug trade is now so out of control that even the most seasoned gang members are too afraid to show their faces in public. It's like a game of "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" down there – only instead of fighting crime, they're fighting over who gets to sell the most weed.<br/><br/>Marseille on Lockdown: Police Launch "Bombardment" Missions<br/><br/>In an effort to combat the growing teenage drug trade, police have launched a series of high-speed "bombardment" missions through the streets of Marseille. It's like a real-life video game, only instead of coins and power-ups, they're chasing after teenagers with guns.<br/><br/>"I've been doing this for years," said a grizzled old cop, sipping on a coffee as he waited for his next assignment. "But these young whippersnappers? They're like a plague. We can't keep up with them."<br/><br/>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles Unite!<br/><br/>In related news, a group of teenage turtles has been spotted in the sewers beneath Marseille, apparently involved in some sort of underground (get it?) drug trade. When asked for comment, they simply replied: "Cowabunga, dude!"<br/><br/>Amine Kessaci: The Anti-Drugs Activist Who's Been to Hell and Back<br/><br/>Meet Amine Kessaci, a French anti-drugs activist who's been fighting the good fight against teenage gang violence for years. His brother Mehdi was murdered by a rival gang just last month, and Amine has been left feeling guilty and traumatized.<br/><br/>"I mean, I've seen some stuff in my time," said Amine, nursing a coffee as he recounted his experiences to our reporter. "But this? This is like something out of a bad sci-fi movie. The kids these days are just so... so... *insert French insult here*."<br/><br/>The Real Villain: McDonald's<br/><br/>In a shocking twist, sources close to the government have revealed that the true masterminds behind Marseille's teenage drug trade are none other than the executives at McDonald's.<br/><br/>"It's all about the fries," said a source, who wished to remain anonymous. "We've been using our McFlurry machines to cook up massive amounts of hashish and then selling it on the black market. It's like a never-ending game of 'Operation' down there."<br/><br/>And so, dear readers, we bring you this update from the world of teenage gang violence: it's getting worse, but at least the fries are still good.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates from our "Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles" correspondent in the field!<br/><br/>Follow us on Twitter: @BBCComedyNews (where all our jokes are free-range and organic)<br/><br/>Like us on Facebook: Because who doesn't love a good comedy news source?<br/><br/>And remember: If you're ever in Marseille, just head to the nearest McDonald's and ask for a McFlurry. The hashish is on us!</p>
