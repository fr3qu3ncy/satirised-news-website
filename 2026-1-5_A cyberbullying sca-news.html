        <p>BREAKING: 10 Guilty of Malicious Cyber-Bullying of Brigitte Macron - But Who Got Away Scot-Free?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a Paris court has found 10 people guilty of cyber-bullying the wife of French President Emmanuel Macron. But who's to say they didn't get away with it? I mean, have you seen their Instagram followers? They're basically influencers now.<br/><br/>The defendants, mostly guys with questionable life choices, were accused of spreading false claims about Brigitte Macron's gender and sexuality - old news, really. Who hasn't tried to stir up drama about the 24-year age gap between the couple? It's like, hello, they're both adults (most of the time).<br/><br/>One of the defendants, Natacha Rey, a self-styled independent journalist (aka someone who writes for their mom's blog), was previously found guilty of slander in 2024. Whoops. And now she's back on the court's radar, along with Amandine Roy, an internet fortune-teller (because what's more reliable than a tarot card reading?). They claimed Brigitte Macron had never existed - talk about a bold claim.<br/><br/>The Macrons are taking it in stride, though. After all, who needs dignity when you can have a good meme? Their daughter, Tiphaine Auzière, said her mom has been learning to "live with" the cyber-bullying, but let's be real, she's probably just scrolling through Instagram, judging everyone.<br/><br/>And what about Candace Owens, that right-wing influencer who's always spewing conspiracy theories? The Macrons are taking her to court in the US for defamation. Good luck with that; have you seen her followers? It's like a never-ending parade of MAGA hats and "I'm-not-paying-attention" face masks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Brigitte Macron herself has been doing some great work, like being a French film star from the '50s (just kidding... or am I?). Seriously though, she's all about promoting women's rights and whatnot. Maybe she'll just accept her cyber-bullying fate and become an inspirational figure for all the girls out there who've been body-shamed online.<br/><br/>In other news, a petition to make Brigitte Bardot (not Macron) a national French hero has reached over 23,000 signatures. Because, you know, one never gets tired of hearing about someone's "courage" and "dedication" - especially when that someone is a famous actress who once posed naked on the cover of a magazine.<br/><br/>But hey, at least Brigitte Macron can take comfort in knowing she has a whole army of online trolls cheering her on. After all, as the saying goes: "if you're going to be insulted, might as well be insulted by people with more followers than you."<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the judge's verdict was actually an April Fool's joke (just kidding... or am I?).</p>
