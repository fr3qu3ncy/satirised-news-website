    <div class="article">
        <p>He is accused of using romance scams to defraud $8m, with the profits flaunted on Instagram... and it's a total disaster!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ghanaian social media influencer Abu Trica (aka Frederick Kumi) has been arrested for allegedly orchestrating a romance scam that swindled elderly Americans out of over $8 million. And what's even more astonishing is that he flaunted his ill-gotten gains on Instagram, because who doesn't love a good display of wealth online?<br/><br/>According to sources, Kumi used AI tools (because nothing says "romance" like a chatbot) to create fake online identities and target victims through social media and dating sites. He then convinced them that he loved them, and that's when the real scamming began. The victims were duped into sending him money for all sorts of ridiculous reasons, including urgent medical needs (code for "I need cash for a new Rolex"), travel expenses (he needed to visit his "love" in person), and investment opportunities (because who doesn't love a good get-rich-quick scheme?).<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Kumi allegedly distributed the loot to his associates in the US and Ghana. It's like he was running some sort of international money-laundering operation... with Instagram selfies.<br/><br/>The case is being prosecuted under the US Elder Abuse Prevention and Prosecution law (or as we like to call it, "Don't Get Scammed, Grandma"). And let me tell you, it's a real doozy. I mean, who needs romance when you can have a good old-fashioned scam?<br/><br/>Additional reporting by Natasha Booty... or was it Bootsie?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Ghanaian government has been cracking down on scammers (but mostly just deporting them to the US). And in a bizarre twist, the White House has been sued by the National Trust for Historic Preservation over plans to demolish the East Wing. Who knew that Abu Trica's Instagram antics would be overshadowed by a good ol' fashioned White House scandal?<br/><br/>And if you thought it couldn't get any weirder, Jason Collins (NBA star and all-around nice guy) revealed his brain cancer diagnosis on Twitter, comparing it to playing against Shaq (because nothing says "brain cancer" like a little friendly competition). And finally, more photos from the Epstein estate were released, featuring President Trump, Clinton, and Prince Andrew in various compromising positions... or not.<br/><br/>Anyway, that's all for now. Stay classy, Abu Trica.</p>
