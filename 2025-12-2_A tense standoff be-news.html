        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela on High Alert as Trump Deploys His Secret Army of Ninja Cats<br/><br/>In a shocking move, President Donald Trump has deployed a large US military force to within striking distance of Venezuela, sparking widespread panic in the South American country.<br/><br/>But why, you ask? Well, it's because Trump is fed up with Venezuela's Nicolas Maduro for being a bit too good at his job. I mean, who needs that kind of competence when you're running a country?<br/><br/>The Trump administration claims that Maduro has been "emptying his prisons and insane asylums" and forcing the inmates to migrate to the US. Because, you know, it's not like they would have gone there on their own free will or anything.<br/><br/>In reality, Trump is just mad because Venezuela's oil reserves are still way more impressive than America's.<br/><br/>The US has deployed 15,000 troops, including a group of highly trained ninja cats (don't ask), to the Caribbean to stop the flow of fentanyl and cocaine to the US. Because, clearly, the solution to this problem is to send a bunch of cats in tiny sunglasses to swim around in the ocean.<br/><br/>The Trump administration argues that it's involved in a non-international armed conflict with the alleged drug traffickers, whom they've dubbed "narco-terrorists." Meanwhile, experts are like, "Uh, no, you can't just call them terrorists and kill them. That's not how this works."<br/><br/>In response to criticism, Trump said that he acted in line with the laws of armed conflict to protect the US from cartels trying to bring poison to our shores. Poison, get it? Like, fentanyl and cocaine are poisonous? Yeah, I'm sure that's exactly what Trump was thinking.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuela's Maduro is like, "Hey, guys, can we just calm down? We're not flooding the US with drugs. We're just trying to make a living over here."<br/><br/>In related news, Kim Kardashian has announced that she'll be launching her own line of Venezuelan-themed merchandise, including T-shirts that read "I'd rather be in Venezuela" and "Maduro for President 2024 (or at least until Trump gets bored again)".<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
