        <p>BREAKING: Ramón Guanipa's Dad is Accused of Treason... for Challenging a Video Game Result<br/><br/>In shocking news, Ramón Guanipa's dad, Juan Pablo Guanipa, has been accused of treason for challenging the disputed result of a 2024 presidential election in a video game. That's right, folks! The guy who created a fake character to win at "Call of Duty" has been arrested and charged with terrorism and treason.<br/><br/>But Wait, There's More!<br/><br/>The Venezuelan government announced that they would release detainees considered political prisoners by human rights groups as a goodwill gesture. And guess what? They actually did it... sort of. Only about 40 people out of more than 800 were released, which is like getting one cookie out of a whole box.<br/><br/>Trump Gets in on the Action<br/><br/>US President Donald Trump jumped into the fray, tweeting that Venezuela had started the process of releasing prisoners "in a BIG WAY." But Ramón Guanipa's dad was not among them. That's when things got really interesting.<br/><br/>Ramón Guanipa's Dad is Like, Totally Not Happy<br/><br/>Ramón Guanipa, Juan Pablo's son, took to social media to express his disappointment and frustration. He said that Trump should not be fooled by the small number of releases and that he should keep pressure on the Venezuelan government to actually do what they say they're going to do.<br/><br/>The Rest of the World is Like, Totally Confused<br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside El Helicoide prison, relatives are keeping vigil, wondering where their loved ones are being held. It's like a real-life game of "Where's Waldo?" except instead of finding Waldo, they're trying to find their family members.<br/><br/>The Venezuelan Government is Like, Totally Not Talking<br/><br/>When asked for comment, the Venezuelan government said nothing, which is like saying they're not interested in talking about it. Meanwhile, Trump is still tweeting about how great things are going in Venezuela and how he's the best thing that's ever happened to them.<br/><br/>And Finally...<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Carmen Farfán's son, José Gregorio Reyes, was detained along with his wife and a friend while they were in hospital. Now, their families are searching for them outside El Helicoide prison, holding signs that say "We Want Our Family Members Back!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! This is like, totally not over yet!</p>
