        <p>GERMAN ARMY AMMUNITION HEIST: THOUSANDS OF ROUNDS STOLEN FROM LORRY, INVESTIGATION UNDERWAY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, thousands of rounds of German army ammunition have been stolen from a delivery lorry in the eastern town of Burg. The theft is believed to have taken place after the driver left his truck in an unguarded parking lot overnight, where he spent the night watching cat videos on his phone and eating Cheetos.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what happened," said the driver, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, I was just trying to beat my high score on 'Flappy Bird' when I fell asleep. Next thing I know, all the ammo is gone!"<br/><br/>The stolen ammunition includes 10,000 rounds of live bullets for pistols, 9,900 rounds of blank bullets for assault rifles, and a few dozen smoke grenades that were left in a cardboard box labeled "Do Not Touch."<br/><br/>"We take this theft very seriously," said a spokesperson for the German defense ministry. "I mean, who needs that many bullets? It's like they're planning some kind of zombie apocalypse or something!"<br/><br/>The investigation is being led by a team of experts from the Bundeswehr (German army) and the local police department. They are working around the clock to track down the thieves and recover the stolen ammunition.<br/><br/>In related news, the German government has announced plans to increase security measures at all parking lots in the country. "We don't want any more ammo getting lost," said a spokesperson for the ministry of defense. "I mean, what if it falls into the wrong hands? It's like they say: 'A man with a pistol is a citizen; a man with 10,000 rounds is a menace!'"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, residents in the surrounding area are on high alert, fearing that the stolen ammunition could fall into the hands of local gangs or, worse still, a group of pesky teenagers looking to start a backyard fireworks display.<br/><br/>"I'm just trying to enjoy my morning coffee without worrying about stray bullets whizzing by," said one resident. "It's like, can't they just leave us alone? We're just trying to live our best lives... with minimal risk of being shot!"<br/><br/>The incident has sparked a heated debate in the German parliament, with some lawmakers calling for stricter security measures and others advocating for a return to the days when everyone had their own personal ammo stash.<br/><br/>As one MP said, "In my day, we didn't need no stinkin' locks on our trucks. We just kept our guns under the seat and called it a day!"<br/><br/>The investigation is ongoing, but one thing is certain: someone will have to answer for this dastardly crime against humanity... or at least against the German army's ammo supplies.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, it has been revealed that the stolen ammunition was actually intended for use in a upcoming music festival. "Yeah, we were planning on using the blank rounds as sound effects," said a spokesperson for the festival organizers. "And the live bullets? Well, we were just going to have some fun with them... you know, like at a shooting gallery or something."<br/><br/>When asked what they planned to do now that the ammo was stolen, the spokesperson shrugged and said, "Well, I guess we'll just have to stick with the usual – you know, the foam guns and the confetti. It's not like it's going to ruin the whole festival or anything..."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
