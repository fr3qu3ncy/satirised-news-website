        <p>GERMAN COURT JAILS MAN FOR DRUGGING, RAPING AND FILMING WIFE... AND PLAYING FLAPPY BIRDS ON THE SIDE<br/><br/>Berlin, Germany - In a shocking turn of events, a German court has sentenced a man to eight-and-a-half years in prison for repeatedly drugging and raping his wife, filming the acts, and then posting them online. But what's even more surprising is that he was caught red-handed while playing Flappy Birds on his phone during the trial.<br/><br/>Fernando P, a 61-year-old Spaniard, was found guilty of aggravated rape, grievous bodily harm, and violation of personal privacy. But the real twist came when he was seen tapping away at his phone, completely oblivious to the gravity of the situation. When asked by the judge if he had anything to say, Fernando P simply replied, "Just a few more levels, your honor."<br/><br/>The court found that Fernando P sedated and raped his wife at their home for several years from 2018 to 2024. But what's even more disturbing is that he not only filmed the abuse but also shared it online with other users. It's like he was running a twisted YouTube channel, complete with comments from other perverts.<br/><br/>The victim's lawyer, Nicole Servaty, said that her client "really had a voice in this proceeding," adding, "She was able to testify, express her feelings, and everything that has burdened her." But what she didn't mention is that the victim was also a huge fan of Flappy Birds and would often play it with Fernando P during their "quality time" together.<br/><br/>The verdict is still subject to appeal, but one thing's for sure - Fernando P will be spending a lot of time behind bars, where he can finally get to level 999 in Flappy Birds without any distractions.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The German prison system has announced that they will be installing Flappy Birds on all inmates' phones as part of their rehabilitation program. It's like they're saying, "Hey, we know you guys are perverts and rapists, but at least you'll have something to do in here."<br/><br/>And if you thought it couldn't get any worse, a spokesperson for the prison system revealed that they've also hired Fernando P as a part-time game tester. When asked why, he simply said, "Hey, someone's got to make sure those birds are flapping properly."</p>
