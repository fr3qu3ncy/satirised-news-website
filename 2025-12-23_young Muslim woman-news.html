        <p>In Nigeria, gunmen kidnapped 28 Muslim travelers and are now demanding a ransom in the form of Taylor Swift concert tickets because, apparently, nothing says "ransom" like an overpriced ticket to see "Shake It Off" performed 17 times straight.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Gunmen Kidnap 28 Muslim Travellers, Demand Ransom in the Form of Taylor Swift Concert Tickets<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, armed men have kidnapped 28 people, including women and children, who were travelling to an annual Islamic event in Nigeria's central Plateau state. The victims, who were all wearing their Sunday best (literally - they had just finished brunch), were ambushed on the road while driving between villages.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the kidnappers, who are believed to be members of a notorious gang known as "The Bandits," demanded that the ransom be paid in the form of Taylor Swift concert tickets. "We want to see her perform 'Shake It Off' at least 17 times in a row," said one of the kidnappers, who wished to remain anonymous. "If we don't get our way, well... let's just say we'll have to take drastic measures."<br/><br/>The police have deployed assets to the affected area to ensure that those abducted are rescued, but officials admit they're running out of options. "We've tried negotiating with them using a combination of Jollof rice and reggae music," said Police Spokesperson Alabo Alfred. "But it seems like they just want Taylor Swift concert tickets."<br/><br/>This is not the first time kidnappers have demanded such unusual ransoms in Nigeria. Just last week, a group of bandits kidnapped a busload of people and demanded that they be paid in Pokémon cards.<br/><br/>The incident has sparked widespread outrage, with many calling for stronger action against the kidnappers. "We can't just sit back and let them get away with this," said local resident Ibrahim Abdullahi. "I mean, what's next? Demanding Beyoncé concert tickets?"<br/><br/>In related news, Taylor Swift's publicist has released a statement saying that she is "flattered" by the kidnappers' demands but "unavailable" to perform in Nigeria at the moment.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The kidnappers have just announced that they will be releasing a single from their upcoming album, titled "The Kidnapper's Lament," featuring Taylor Swift on guest vocals.</p>
