        <h2>PUTIN'S SAMOSA SECRET: What Really Brought Him to India?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's surprise visit to India has sparked a frenzy of diplomacy, defense deals, and samosa-filled hijinks, leaving experts to wonder if it's all just a ruse for him to get his hands on some tasty Indian snacks.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>PUTIN IN INDIA: A TALE OF OIL, DEFENCE, AND GEOPOLITICS (BUT NOT NANNY MCFLY)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin has arrived in India for a two-day visit, leaving behind his trusty sidekick, Danny DeVito. Sources close to the Kremlin confirm that Putin was last seen arguing with a group of Indian street vendors over the price of a good samosa.<br/><br/>As Putin touched down in Delhi, he was greeted by Prime Minister Narendra Modi, who was dressed in a bespoke three-piece suit and sporting a hairdo that could only be described as " Business-class Bollywood". The two leaders were seen embracing warmly on the runway, before breaking into an impromptu rendition of "I Will Survive" – complete with choreographed dance moves.<br/><br/>But what's really at stake here? Well, it turns out that India and Russia have been planning a special trade deal – one that will see them sell each other's oil supplies to the highest bidder. In fact, sources close to the Indian government confirm that they've already ordered a fleet of Russian-made oil tankers to transport the precious liquid across the country.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts are speculating about the significance of Putin's visit. "It's clear that Russia is trying to flex its muscles," says Dr. Henry Kissinger, a renowned expert on international relations and wearer of many hats (including a rather fetching fedora). "By visiting India, Putin is sending a message to the West: 'Hey, we may have invaded Ukraine, but we're still friends with the subcontinent!'".<br/><br/>And then there's the matter of defence sales. It's been reported that Russia will be selling state-of-the-art fighter jets and air defence systems to India – a move that has left some observers wondering if this is just a ruse to get their hands on some of those tasty Indian snacks.<br/><br/>But what really matters here? Not the geopolitics, not the trade deals – it's all about the food. Specifically, the samosas. Sources close to the Kremlin confirm that Putin has requested an emergency shipment of these tasty little pastries to be flown in from Mumbai specifically for his visit.<br/><br/>And so, as Putin and Modi continue their diplomatic dance, we can't help but wonder: what's next? Will India invite Danny DeVito over for a state dinner? Or will Putin try to convince Modi to join him on the set of "The Mask"? Only time (and possibly a few rounds of negotiations) will tell.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! This is one diplomatic visit you won't want to miss.</p>
