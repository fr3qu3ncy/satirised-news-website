        <p>DEEP-SEA MINING SHOCKER: MACHINES DESTROY OVER A THIRD OF SEABED ANIMALS, SCIENTISTS WARN OF DOOMSDAY FOR PLANET<br/><br/>In a shocking revelation that has left scientists and environmentalists scrambling for their calculators, deep-sea mining machines have been found to be utterly destroying over a third of the seabed's animal population. It's like someone took a giant vacuum cleaner and sucked up all the cute, cuddly creatures living in the Pacific Ocean.<br/><br/>According to top-secret sources (okay, it was just some scientists), the machines, which were designed to mine minerals from the deep ocean floor, have been leaving a trail of destruction in their wake. The impact is so severe that over 37% of the animals found in the tracks of these metal monsters are now extinct. That's like... um... a LOT of fish.<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking: "But wait, don't we need those minerals for our fancy green technologies?" And to that, we say... yes and no. Yes, we do need them, but at what cost? The researchers found over 4,000 animals living on the seafloor in a remote area of the Pacific Ocean, including some species that were previously unknown to science (yawn). However, most of these creatures are now either dead or have moved away to find safer pastures.<br/><br/>But here's the kicker: it gets worse. The scientists also discovered that pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species, like a certain famous cartoon character who lives in a pineapple under the sea (just kidding, it's actually just some worms and snails).<br/><br/>The Study: A Deep Dive into Disaster<br/><br/>Led by Eva Stewart, a PhD student at the Natural History Museum and the University of Southampton, the research team compared biodiversity two years before and two months after the test mining that drove machines for 80km on the seafloor. They looked specifically at animals 0.3mm – 2cm in size, because, you know, they're just so tiny.<br/><br/>The results were astounding: the number of animals fell by 37% and the diversity of species by 32%. As Dr. Guadalupe Bribiesca-Contreras from the National Oceanography Centre put it, "Even if they are not killed by the machine, pollution from the mining operations could slowly kill some less resilient species." Yikes.<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! The Metals Company, the deep-sea mining company behind this environmental catastrophe, is still optimistic. Their spokesperson said, "After years of activist alarm that our impacts would spread thousands of kilometers beyond the mine site, the data show that any biodiversity impacts are limited to the directly mined area." Yeah, because nothing says "limited" like a third of the animal population being wiped out.<br/><br/>The Conundrum: To Mine or Not to Mine<br/><br/>Deep-sea mining is currently not permitted until more is known about its environmental impacts. But with demand for critical minerals set to at least double by 2040, it's like trying to solve a puzzle blindfolded while being attacked by a swarm of bees.<br/><br/>Dr. Patrick Schröder, senior research fellow at the Environment and Society Centre at think tank Chatham House, said, "I think the study shows that current technologies for harvesting are too damaging to permit large-scale commercial exploration." Ouch.<br/><br/>The Verdict: Planet in Peril<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. The future of our planet is looking bleaker than ever. Deep-sea mining machines are destroying over a third of the seabed's animal population, and we're left wondering what other environmental disasters await us.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story... or not. We'll just be over here, waiting for the apocalypse to come.</p>
