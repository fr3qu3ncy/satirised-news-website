        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>"Border Villagers Abducted and Taken to Russia, Says Ukraine... But Wait, Where's Chuck Norris?"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Ukrainian authorities have revealed that 52 residents from the village of Hrabovske were abducted by Russian forces and taken to Russia. But, in a shocking twist, the villagers' favorite action hero, Chuck Norris, was nowhere to be found.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the Russian troops stormed into the village at night, rounded up the civilians, and whisked them away to Belgorod, a major regional center about 50 miles inside Russia. "It was like something out of a bad movie," said Volodymyr Bitsak, a member of the Sumy regional council. "I mean, who abducts villagers? And where's Chuck Norris when you need him?"<br/><br/>The Ukrainian military has vowed to take action against the Russian invaders, but with Chuck Norris missing in action, it's unclear what impact this will have on the conflict.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin was seen laughing maniacally and stroking a cat while watching a rerun of "The Terminator" at his Kremlin office. When asked about the abduction, he simply shrugged and said, "I'm shocked... SHOCKED! I had no idea Chuck Norris was in Ukraine."<br/><br/>In related news, the world's most famous martial artist, Jackie Chan, has offered to help mediate a peace treaty between Ukraine and Russia. However, sources close to the negotiations have revealed that Putin is insisting on a duel with Jackie to settle any disputes.<br/><br/>"What's Next?"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is certain: Chuck Norris will be back, and he'll be bringing his beard.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates from the BBC News team.</p>
