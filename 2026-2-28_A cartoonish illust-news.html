        <p>BREAKING: World Leaders React to Iran-US-Israeli Brawl with Surprising Doses of Sarcasm and Awkwardness<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, world leaders have been responding to the recent US-Israeli strikes on Iranian cities with reactions ranging from shockingly serious to downright ridiculous. As you read this article, imagine a giant game of international Diplomatic Jenga happening in real-time.<br/><br/>United Nations Secretary-General Antonio Guterres: "Oh no, oh me! The use of force by the United States and Israel against Iran, and the subsequent retaliation by Iran across the region, undermine international peace and security!" (in a squeaky voice)<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a surprise move, Saudi Arabia's Foreign Ministry released an official statement that started with: "Hey, guys, don't forget we're here too! We totally get it, the Iranian aggression thing, but can we talk about Bahrain, UAE, Qatar, Jordan, and Kuwait for a hot second?" The Saudi ministry ended the statement by ordering pizza for all Middle Eastern leaders.<br/><br/>Russian Foreign Ministry: "Reckless move, guys! You know what? Russia's got nothing to do with this... except for our top-secret underwater lair in Dubai. That's totally not involved." <br/><br/>The Kremlin also threatened to release a viral TikTok dance challenge that will make everyone forget about the crisis.<br/><br/>French President Emmanuel Macron: "Ooh la la, zut alors! We're calling an emergency UN Security Council meeting, pronto! And can someone please pass me another croissant? I'm starving!"<br/><br/>Macron's statement was followed by a series of dramatic pauses and whispers to his advisors. Later that day, he posted on X: "When will we learn to communicate like civilized human beings?"<br/><br/>Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni: After consulting her tarot cards, Meloni announced she'd be calling an emergency meeting with regional leaders to discuss ways to ease tensions... or find the perfect gelato recipe. The Italian government also released a statement saying they'll provide "expert advice" on how to avoid getting caught in diplomatic crossfires.<br/><br/>United States President Donald Trump: "Hey, folks! Just wanted to remind everyone that our objective is to defend the American people by eliminating imminent threats from the Iranian regime... while simultaneously tweeting about my fantastic hair day. #TruthSocial"<br/><br/>Trump's Truth Social followers responded with memes and GIFs of him holding up a giant, sparkly American flag made entirely out of dental floss.<br/><br/>UN Human Rights Chief Volker Türk: "Hey, guys! Let's all take a deep breath and remember we're human beings here. Can we please just get along? Oh, wait, I forgot – there are more important things in life... like my cat's Instagram account."<br/><br/>As the situation unfolds, it remains unclear who will be the first to send out a strongly-worded email or tweet demanding respect for their nation's sovereignty (with excessive use of capital letters). One thing is certain: this crisis will continue until everyone gets tired and goes home to watch Netflix.<br/><br/>Breaking News Update: The United Nations Security Council just voted 5-3 in favor of sending pizza to all parties involved. World leaders are reportedly thrilled about the prospect of free food, but still at odds over who gets to eat the anchovies.</p>
