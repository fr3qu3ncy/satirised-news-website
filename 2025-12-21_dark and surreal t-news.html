        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>GUNMEN SLAY NINE IN SOUTH AFRICA TAVERN ATTACK, BUT IT'S NOT ALL BAD - THERE WAS FREE FOOD AND DRINK!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, nine people were killed and 10 injured in Bekkersdal, South Africa, after about 12 unidentified gunmen arrived in two vehicles, opened fire at patrons, and continued to shoot randomly as people fled the scene. But wait, there's more!<br/><br/>As it turns out, the shooters were not just any ordinary thugs - they were actually trained ninjas from the secret ninja society of Johannesburg. Yes, you read that right! These stealthy assassins had been hired by a group of disgruntled McDonald's employees who were upset about the lack of free fries in their employee cafeteria.<br/><br/>The motive for this attack was not just to cause chaos and destruction, but also to protest against the poor quality of coffee at the local Starbucks. I mean, who doesn't love a good cup of joe, right?<br/><br/>As the police arrived on the scene, they were greeted by a group of confused bystanders who were trying to figure out what had happened. One resident was heard saying, "I was just enjoying a nice cold Castle beer when suddenly everyone started running around like headless chickens. I thought it was just another Friday night in Bekkersdal!"<br/><br/>The deputy provincial police commissioner, Maj-Gen Fred Kekana, was seen struggling to maintain his composure as he tried to make sense of the situation. "It's just another day in South Africa," he said with a straight face. "I mean, who needs peace and tranquility when you can have free food and drink, right?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the South African Gunowners' Association has come out in support of the shooters, saying that they were simply exercising their Second Amendment rights. "It's not about gun control," said Gideon Joubert, the association's president. "It's about self-defense... against the threat of bad coffee."<br/><br/>And so, as the people of Bekkersdal try to make sense of this bizarre attack, one thing is clear: in South Africa, you can't even enjoy a quiet night out without someone trying to shoot you.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: The police have now released a statement saying that they are investigating the possibility of a connection between this attack and a group of rogue accountants who were trying to sabotage the local tax system. We will keep you updated as more information becomes available.<br/><br/>ANOTHER UPDATE: It has just been announced that the shooters have been caught and are being held in custody. They are facing charges of murder, attempted murder, and excessive caffeine consumption.</p>
