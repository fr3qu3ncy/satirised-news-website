        <p>THE MAKING OF A WWE LEGEND: JOHN CENA FACES HIS FINAL FIGHT... AND WE'VE GOT THE TEA!<br/><br/> Ah, dear readers, gather 'round and prepare for a comedy extravaganza like no other. We're talking about the retirement of John Cena, the WWE superstar who's been body-slamming his way into our hearts for nearly two decades.<br/><br/>And what better way to celebrate this occasion than by imagining a world where John Cena is actually a 48-year-old man-child still living in his parents' basement? Yeah, let's go with that!<br/><br/>John Cena: The Man Who Never Gave Up... or Showered<br/><br/>As we all know, John Cena's illustrious career has been marked by his incredible wrestling skills and his iconic "You Can't See Me" catchphrase. But what you may not know is that he's also a master of the art of doing absolutely nothing.<br/><br/>In fact, sources close to Cena (okay, it was just his mom) have revealed that he's spent the past 20 years perfecting the craft of being a professional couch surfer. Who needs a gym membership when you can just stay in your PJs and binge-watch Netflix all day?<br/><br/>And don't even get us started on his signature move: the "Never Give Up" dance. It's a classic, folks! Just imagine Cena busting out his best (worst?) dance moves to the tune of some obscure techno song at 3 AM while wearing nothing but a pair of boxers and a fedora.<br/><br/>The Rock Calls John Cena Out<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson has been spotted laughing hysterically at the mere mention of John Cena's name. When asked what he thought about Cena's impending retirement, The Rock simply said, "Finally! I can go back to being the greatest wrestler of all time... and not have to share the spotlight with that guy."<br/><br/>Ouch, burn!<br/><br/>John Cena Grants Wishes... for Free Pizza<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Did you know that John Cena holds a Guinness World Record for granting the most wishes through the Make-A-Wish Foundation? It's true! And what do all these kids wish for, you ask? Why, it's not world peace or curing cancer, no sir. It's free pizza parties with their favorite WWE superstar.<br/><br/>Because, let's be real, who needs world domination when you can have a never-ending supply of pepperoni and anchovies?<br/><br/>The Retirement Party<br/><br/>And so, on Saturday night, the curtains will draw to a close on John Cena's wrestling career. But don't worry, folks; we're sure he'll still find time to squeeze in some quality gaming sessions with his Xbox friends and maybe even land a few more Make-A-Wish grants for free pizzas.<br/><br/>It's been real, Cena. Now go ahead and take that well-deserved nap on the couch – you've earned it!</p>
