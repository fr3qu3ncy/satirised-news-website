        <p>**BREAKING NEWS: Technical Tie Ensues as Candidates' Lawyers Get into Fistfight Over Who Got the Most Votes**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Honduran presidential election has ended in a stunning "technical tie" between right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura and former TV host Salvador Nasralla. According to sources close to the electoral council, the two candidates are neck-and-neck with a paltry 515 votes separating them.<br/><br/>As the news broke, lawyers for both camps got into an argument over who got the most votes. Witnesses claim that one lawyer from Asfura's camp started throwing punches at a Nasralla supporter, only to be met by a swift kick to the shin from none other than Hulk Hogan himself.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get some fresh air when suddenly I found myself in the middle of a bar brawl," said a bewildered local resident. "I mean, who brings Hulk Hogan to a presidential election dispute? It's like something out of a bad sitcom."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Asfura has denied any wrongdoing and blamed the electoral council for the delay in releasing the results. Nasralla, on the other hand, has vowed to fight on, even if it means taking his case all the way to the Supreme Court.<br/><br/>"I'm not giving up yet," said an undeterred Nasralla. "I've got my trusty sidekick, a chicken named Cluck Norris, who's been trained in the art of electioneering. Together, we'll get to the bottom of this and come out on top!"<br/><br/>As tensions continue to rise, locals have taken to the streets with signs that read "Asfura or Nasralla: Who Cares?" and "Can We Just Have a Re-Run of the Election with Snack Time Included?"<br/><br/>The US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the situation, tweeting "Sad! Fake news saying I'm involved in election meddling. Truth is, I just wanted to make Honduras great again...with an American-style fast food joint."<br/><br/>As the country teeters on the brink of chaos, one thing's for sure: this election will go down in history as one of the most bizarre and hilarious in Honduran history.<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** The electoral council has announced that they'll be conducting a manual recount of ballots while also investigating claims of Hulk Hogan's involvement. In related news, Cluck Norris has been spotted at a local KFC franchise, allegedly training for a showdown with Asfura's campaign team. Stay tuned for further updates!</p>
