        <p>ALICE IN WONDERLAND LEADS JANJAWEED, A GROUP WHOSE CAMPAIGN OF TERROR LED TO HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF DEATHS... OR SO WE'RE TOLD<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the International Criminal Court (ICC) has sentenced Ali Muhammad Ali Abd-Al-Rahman, aka Alice in Wonderland, to 20 years in prison for his role as leader of the Janjaweed militia group during the Darfur conflict. Yes, you read that right - Alice in Wonderland, the beloved children's book character known for her wild adventures and eccentric behavior.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the ICC, Alice led the Janjaweed on a campaign of terror against the people of Darfur, resulting in hundreds of thousands of deaths. But don't worry, it wasn't all bad - they did have some lovely tea parties while they were at it.<br/><br/>"I'm shocked and appalled by this verdict," said the Cheshire Cat, longtime friend and confidant to Alice. "Alice was just trying to find her way through the Looking-Glass world of politics and ended up getting caught up in a war. It's all very confusing."<br/><br/>As leader of the Janjaweed, Alice gave orders to his loyal followers to "wipe out and sweep away" non-Arab tribes. But don't worry, they did it with a smile on their faces - because, you know, that's what happens when you're having a good time.<br/><br/>Judge Joanna Korner of the ICC was not amused, however. "Ali Abd-Al-Rahman, aka Alice in Wonderland, gave orders to his loyal followers to commit atrocities against innocent people," she said sternly. "And then they had tea parties while they were at it. It's just... ugh."<br/><br/>The verdict has sent shockwaves throughout the international community, with many leaders calling for greater accountability and transparency from the ICC.<br/><br/>"I demand that Alice be released immediately and given a parade in her honor," said Queen of Hearts, ruler of Wonderland and long-time fan of Alice. "After all, someone's got to keep the Looking-Glass world interesting."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts are weighing in on the implications of this shocking verdict.<br/><br/>"This is a major setback for the Janjaweed militia group," said Dr. Matthew Benson-Strohmayer, Sudan Research Director at the London School of Economics. "I mean, who needs a decent cup of tea when you've got hundreds of thousands of deaths to your name?"<br/><br/>In related news, the White Rabbit has announced plans to run for president of Wonderland on a platform of "more cake and less war."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The ICC has just announced that Alice's sentence will be served in a special maximum-security prison built by the Mad Hatter, complete with teacups and playing cards.</p>
