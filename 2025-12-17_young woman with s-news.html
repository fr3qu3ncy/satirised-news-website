        <p>The Slanted-Eyes Scandal: Miss Finland's Viral Photo Stirs Up a Storm<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former Miss Universe contestant Sarah Dzafce has found herself at the center of a racism firestorm after a photo of her pulling the corners of her eyes went viral. The slanted-eyes pose is not exactly the most flattering or respectful gesture towards East Asians, and Finland's prime minister was quick to condemn it as "thoughtless and stupid."<br/><br/>But that's not all - Sarah Dzafce claimed the gesture was just a result of a headache during dinner, which her friend added an offensive caption to without her consent. One could argue that this is just a classic case of "I didn't mean to do anything wrong, I'm just a victim of circumstance!"<br/><br/>However, Finnish Prime Minister Petteri Orpo wasn't buying it, saying that lawmakers should set an example of proper conduct and not engage in childish behavior like mimicking the slanted-eyes gesture. Two right-wing MPs, Juho Eerola and Kaisa Garedew, had posted photos of themselves making the same gesture to show their support for Miss Dzafce, but they quickly took them down after backlash.<br/><br/>The controversy has also drawn attention in Japan, South Korea, and China, with many calling for an investigation into anti-Asian discrimination. A Japanese man living in Finland even launched a petition calling for an investigation, which had gathered over 7,000 signatures as of Sunday evening.<br/><br/>Finnair, the national airline of Finland, weighed in on the controversy, saying that it had affected the company and that there had been calls for tourists to boycott Finland. One could almost hear them whispering "oh no, our tourism industry is going down the drain because of this one photo!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Miss Dzafce apologized for the photo, saying that it had caused ill will in many people. But some people were not convinced by her apology, calling it "insincere" given that it was written in Finnish.<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one can't help but wonder what kind of lesson Miss Dzafce learned from this experience. Perhaps she'll become an expert on cultural sensitivity and awareness? Or maybe she'll just stick to being a beauty queen?<br/><br/>In any case, the controversy has sparked a national conversation in Finland about racism and anti-Asian discrimination, which is definitely a good thing. After all, as the saying goes "when life gives you lemons, make lemonade" - or in this case, when life gives you a slanted-eyes photo, use it as an opportunity to learn and grow!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Swatch has since apologized for their own 'slanted eyes' ad after China's uproar. Who knew that watches could be so sensitive about cultural appropriation?</p>
