        <p>BREAKING: Donald Trump's Epic Fail at Being a Nobel Winner's BFF<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has publicly dismissed the brilliant and fabulous María Corina Machado, Nobel Peace Prize winner extraordinaire, saying she didn't have his support or respect. Like, what even is that? Has Trump ever met a woman he didn't dislike?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (okay, it's just us), Trump was seen muttering "she doesn't have my back" while eating a box of Cheez-Its in the Oval Office. When asked for comment, Trump's team simply shrugged and said, "Oh, you mean that whole 'being a nice person' thing? Yeah, no one does that anymore."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Machado was overheard saying, "Pffft, who needs the support of a reality TV star when you've got the love and adoration of the people?" As she sipped champagne and adjusted her Nobel Peace Prize medal (which is totally not like the kind of thing someone would use to make fun of Trump), she added, "Besides, I'm just too fabulous for his taste. He's stuck in the Stone Age, and I'm over here being a 21st-century superhero!"<br/><br/>But let's get back to reality – or at least, what passes for it when Donald Trump is involved. According to our sources (okay, we made this up), Trump was spotted trying to "help" Machado with her Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech by suggesting she talk about her favorite flavor of ice cream (chocolate chip cookie dough, naturally). And, in a bizarre twist, he also tried to convince her that the true meaning of life is to sell more copies of his book "The Art of the Deal."<br/><br/>In related news, Venezuela's new interim president Delcy Rodríguez was seen sipping a piña colada and declaring, "I'm not going anywhere! The people have chosen me, and I will make sure they get all the avocado toast they need!" (We're pretty sure she didn't say that last part, but we like to think so.)<br/><br/>As for Machado, she's still rocking that Nobel Peace Prize like it's nobody's business. And honestly? We can't blame her one bit.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Donald Trump was seen storming out of the Oval Office, muttering something about "fake news" and "crazy people." When asked what was wrong, he responded, "Just the usual – trying to make America great again while also being a functioning human being. It's like trying to juggle chainsaws while reciting Shakespearean sonnets... but with more hair dye."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THIS BREAKING STORY! (We'll probably just be making fun of Donald Trump some more.)</p>
