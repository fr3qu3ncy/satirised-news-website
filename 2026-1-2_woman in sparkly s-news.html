        <p>COLORADO OFFICIALS CONFIRMED TO BE LOST IN MOUNTAIN LION ENCOUNTER<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Colorado officials have confirmed that a woman was killed by a mountain lion in the state's remote wilderness. If confirmed, this would be the first fatal attack by a mountain lion in over 25 years.<br/><br/>But here's the twist: the woman was not just any ordinary hiker. She was actually a professional line-dancer from Texas, known for her impressive moves to "The Electric Slide." Her name is Bertha Jenkins, and she had been hiking alone on the Crosier Mountain Trail when tragedy struck.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the mountain lion, estimated to be around 5'10" with a menacing scowl, pounced on Bertha like it was performing an epic dance move. Witnesses described the scene as "like watching a cat video go viral on YouTube."<br/><br/>Colorado Parks and Wildlife officials have confirmed that two mountain lions were euthanized in connection with the incident. However, they refused to reveal whether one of the cats was a repeat offender or if it had a history of catfishing.<br/><br/>In related news, Governor Jared Polis has announced that the state will be launching a new program to provide free catnip to all residents as a precautionary measure against future mountain lion attacks.<br/><br/>Bertha's family has released a statement saying she died doing what she loved most - "line-dancing on the mountain trails while wearing sparkly shoes." They also thanked the hikers who had thrown rocks at the mountain lion, saying they were heroes for saving everyone else from having to watch a 2-hour cat video loop.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, residents in neighboring Wyoming are now panicking about their own mountain lion population. "I mean, I knew there was a stray puma wandering around, but I didn't know it had a personal vendetta against line-dancers," said one local resident.<br/><br/>As for Bertha's legacy, a new dance move has been named after her: the "Mountain Lion Stomp." It involves a series of dramatic arm flails and hip swivels while exclaiming, "Run, kitty, run!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story.</p>
