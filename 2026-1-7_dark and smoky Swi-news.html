        <p>BREAKING: New Year's Eve Fire at Swiss Ski Bar Was Like a Real-Life 'Die Hard' Movie, But Without the Bruce Willis<br/><br/>Crans-Montana, Switzerland - In a bizarre incident that would make even the most seasoned action movie star go "yippee ki yi yay," a fire broke out at a ski bar in Crans-Montana on New Year's Eve, killing 40 people and injuring 116. Yes, you read that right - 40 people died, but don't worry, they were all wearing their party hats, so it was like one big happy (dead) family.<br/><br/>The fire, which started when a champagne bottle with a sparkler attached set light to the sound-insulating foam on the ceiling, was like a scene from 'Die Hard,' but without Bruce Willis. I mean, who needs Bruce Willis when you have 116 people running around with severe burns, right?<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the bar's two managers, Jacques and Jessica Moretti (who sounds like a pair of French superheroes), were last seen trying to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher and some fancy footwork. Unfortunately, they didn't quite make it - just like Nicolas Cage in 'Con Air' when he tried to escape from prison by flying an airplane.<br/><br/>"We're devastated," said Jacques Moretti, wiping away tears from his sparkler-tattooed face. "We never thought our champagne bottle trick would go so wrong."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, has promised to take responsibility for the disaster and has vowed to ban sparklers in local venues. "We're going to make sure that no one else gets hurt by these pesky sparklers," he said, adding that they will be replaced with more conventional fire-starting devices, like lighters or matches.<br/><br/>SWISS SKI BAR NOT INSPECTED FOR FIVE YEARS BEFORE DEADLY FIRE<br/><br/>In a shocking revelation, officials have admitted that the ski bar had not undergone safety checks for five years. Yes, you heard that right - five whole years! It's like they were waiting for someone to point out the obvious, like the fact that the fire extinguishers were still being used as plant holders.<br/><br/>The Swiss authorities are now scrambling to figure out what went wrong and why the bar wasn't inspected in so long. "We're not sure how we missed it," said a spokesperson for the local government. "But hey, at least we got the sparklers ban right, didn't we?"<br/><br/>FUNERALS FOR VICTIMS BEING HELD<br/><br/>As the funerals for the victims are being held, many have taken to social media to express their shock and sadness at the tragedy. "This is just like something out of a disaster movie," tweeted @SparklerSally. "I mean, who needs actual danger when you can get your sparklers on?"<br/><br/>In related news, the local ski resort has announced that it will be offering a special 'Sparkler-Free' package for all future visitors. It includes a complimentary fire extinguisher and a discount on all souvenir champagne bottles.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
