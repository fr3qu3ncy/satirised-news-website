        <p>BREAKING: Kenya becomes the first African country to secure US health funding since cuts to foreign aid by Trump, but there's a catch - they've also agreed to let KFC come in and set up shop in all their hospitals<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Kenya has signed a historic five-year health agreement with the US, making them the first African country to do so since Donald Trump's administration overhauled its foreign aid programme. The deal is worth $2.5 billion (£1.9 billion) and aims to combat infectious diseases in Kenya, but there's a small print that nobody seems to be talking about - KFC is now going to be the official snack provider for all Kenyan hospitals.<br/><br/>Yes, you read that right. KFC. The finger-lickin' good chicken joint has somehow managed to sneak its way into the agreement, much to the dismay of health experts and nutritionists everywhere. "What's next?" said one outraged doctor. "Are they going to start serving McDonald's in maternity wards?"<br/><br/>The deal was signed by Kenya's President William Ruto and US Secretary of State Marco Rubio, who praised Kenya for their role in leading the UN-backed mission to combat powerful gangs in Haiti - but didn't mention anything about KFC.<br/><br/>"This is a landmark agreement," said Rubio. "And I'm not just talking about the healthcare benefits. I mean, have you seen the size of the bucket meals they're going to be serving at these hospitals? It's a game-changer."<br/><br/>Kenya's Health Minister Aden Duale tried to calm fears that the US would gain access to sensitive patient information by saying "only de-identified, aggregated data" would be shared. But when asked about KFC, he just shrugged and said "oh, that's just between us and the Americans".<br/><br/>US officials have yet to comment on the KFC fiasco, but sources close to the White House have hinted that it was a last-minute add-on to the agreement in exchange for a special dispensation to sell Big Macs in Kenyan hospitals.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, lawyers are already sounding off about potential lawsuits. "What specific data categories are being shared?" said Willis Otieno, a lawyer in Kenya. "Are genomic data, disease patterns, mental health data, insurance claims, hospital records, or biometrics included? And what's with the KFC?"<br/><br/>Nelson Amenya, a whistle-blower, echoed similar concerns. "We need to see the full agreement so we can read it for ourselves and figure out how they're going to make us eat fried chicken in our hospitals."<br/><br/>But Ruto remained confident that the deal would bring much-needed healthcare benefits to his people - as long as nobody asks him about the KFC part.<br/><br/>"I assure you that every shilling and every dollar will be spent efficiently, effectively, and accountably," he said. "And by accountable, I mean we'll make sure to keep a close eye on those KFC buckets."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story - and try not to think about the smell of fried chicken wafting through Kenyan hospitals<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>(Disclaimer: None of this actually happened.
