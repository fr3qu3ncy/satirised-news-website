        <p>Nine newborn babies died at a Russian hospital because their doctors were too busy arguing over whose turn it was to watch Netflix to check on them.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: 9 Babies Die in Siberian Hospital, Doctors Arrested for Not Being Good Enough<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a group of doctors in Novokuznetsk, Russia were arrested yesterday for failing to save the lives of 9 newborn babies who died during the long New Year holiday. The hospital staff was so incompetent that they couldn't even keep the babies alive for more than a few days.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, the doctors were so busy arguing over whose turn it was to watch Netflix that they forgot to check on the babies. "We were like, 'Oh no, not again!' every time we saw another baby flatlining," said one of the staff members who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, it's not like we didn't have enough warning signs - I mean, have you seen those tiny little lungs? They're just begging to fail."<br/><br/>The hospital has since announced that they will no longer accept patients due to a higher-than-usual rate of respiratory infections caused by the sheer incompetence of their staff. In fact, they've even hired a team of professional babysitters to care for the remaining babies - and they're doing a much better job.<br/><br/>As one of the arrested doctors was led away in handcuffs, he shouted, "But what about my Netflix subscription? I'm pretty sure it's still active!" The other doctor just shook his head and muttered, "Typical."<br/><br/>UPDATE: The hospital has since apologized for the incident and promised to do better next time. In a statement, they said, "We understand that 9 babies dying in our care is unacceptable. We will make sure to hire more competent staff... or at least someone who knows how to use Google."</p>
