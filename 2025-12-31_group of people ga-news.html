        <p>As the world welcomed 2026 in style, everything that could go wrong did, including fireworks displays gone wrong, popes struggling to unveil plaques, and a baby seal winning a pool championship.</p>

        <p>Countries around the world celebrate New Year's with colour and chaos<br/><br/>It's that time of year again, folks! The planet has come together to welcome 2026 in style. Or should I say, in utter madness? From fireworks displays gone wrong to popes struggling to unveil plaques, it's been a wild ride.<br/><br/>In New Zealand and Australia, the first places to bid adieu to 2025, people gathered to watch bright fireworks explode across iconic backdrops. But, things quickly took a turn for the worse when a stray sparkler set fire to a nearby barbeque, forcing authorities to evacuate the area with a fleet of Segways.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Bangkok, crowds enjoyed a massive fireworks display around the Great Buddha of Thailand. Or, at least they tried to. It turns out, the pyrotechnicians had a slight misfire, covering the entire crowd in a sticky layer of marshmallow-flavored gelatin. Talk about a sticky situation!<br/><br/>And let's not forget Beijing, where the drums and light show was more like a cat-and-mouse game between audience members and malfunctioning fog machines. It was like they say: "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But when life gives you faulty fog machines, just pretend it's a really weird art installation."<br/><br/>As for Pope Leo, he had his own share of mishaps when trying to unveil a plaque at an Istanbul cathedral. After several attempts and some heavy tugging from the church staff, they finally managed to remove the cloth covering the plaque – only to reveal that it was actually just a picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger in a sombrero.<br/><br/>In other news, NASA astronaut Jonny Kim and cosmonauts Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky returned to Earth after 245 days on the ISS. And by "returned," I mean they landed their spacecraft in a nearby swimming pool surrounded by blue pavilions and palm trees – a gift from their fellow astronauts, who just happened to be huge fans of Jeff Goldblum's "Jurassic Park" sequels.<br/><br/>Oh, and did you hear about the baby seal that walked into a bar in Richmond, New Zealand? Yeah, that was a thing. It turns out, seals are actually expert pool players – and this little guy had just won the regional championship before deciding to pop by for a celebratory pint of fish oil-flavored beer.<br/><br/>Last but not least, Donald Trump made headlines once again when he claimed Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman "knew nothing" about Jamal Khashoggi's murder. When asked to comment on this claim, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, I'm no expert – but I do know that the real victim here is my hair. That guy's got some serious follicle envy going on."<br/><br/>And so, as we bid adieu to 2025 and welcome the new year with open arms (and possibly a few Band-Aids), let's just say it's shaping up to be an interesting ride. Happy New Year, folks!</p>
