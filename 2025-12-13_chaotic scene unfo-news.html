        <p>CHAOS ERUPTS AT MESSI EVENT IN INDIA<br/><br/>Well, folks, it looks like the adoring fans of Lionel Messi in India finally got a glimpse of their hero, but not exactly under the most pleasant circumstances. Thousands had paid up to 12,000 rupees (£100; $133) to catch a whiff of his greatness, but were left feeling like they'd been robbed by a group of officials and security who just couldn't get out of the way fast enough.<br/><br/>Imagine shelling out that kind of cash for a selfie with Messi, only to have him whisked away after 20 minutes like he was on a mission to save the world from certain doom. The crowd went berserk, folks! Water bottles were thrown onto the pitch (don't worry, they weren't filled with actual water), and stadium seats were ripped up like confetti at a Donald Trump rally.<br/><br/>West Bengal's chief minister, Mamata Banerjee, was "deeply disturbed" by the whole ordeal. Who wouldn't be? I mean, it's not every day you see grown adults acting like they just lost their last rupee in a game of street cricket.<br/><br/>As for Messi himself, well, he seemed to be having the time of his life – right up until he was escorted away from the scene by his entourage. Who can blame him? I mean, have you seen the prices of those selfie tickets? It's like they were selling moonbeams and fairy dust out there!<br/><br/>OTHER STORIES FROM THE REGION<br/><br/>In other news, Indonesia is still trying to clean up the mess left behind by a recent flood that killed at least 80 people. Meanwhile, in Sri Lanka, another 56 folks bit the dust due to extreme weather conditions. Yeah, it's been one of those weeks.<br/><br/>But hey, on the bright side, researchers in Indonesia finally found that rare Rafflesia hasseltii flower after 13 years of searching. Now we can all marvel at its beauty and wonder what the heck it smells like (spoiler alert: it's reportedly pretty terrible).<br/><br/>And if you thought things were wild in India, just wait until you hear about the bear that wandered onto an airport tarmac in Japan and caused a temporary halt to flights. Talk about a furry little Houdini!<br/><br/>WORLD NEWS BRIEFS<br/><br/>* In Hong Kong, over 800 firefighters are still battling a blaze at a tower block that's killed at least 44 people.<br/>* A Japanese volcano has erupted, spewing ash clouds everywhere – and by "everywhere," I mean all over the surrounding countryside. Yeah, it's been one of those weeks.<br/>* And finally, in Bangladesh, former Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity. Who knew being a head of state could be so... deadly?<br/><br/>That's it for now, folks! Stay safe out there and try not to get too upset about the price of selfie tickets.</p>
