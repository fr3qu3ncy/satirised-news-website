        <p>ROB REINER'S SON NICK ARRESTED ON SUSPICION OF MURDER AFTER DIRECTOR AND WIFE FOUND DEAD<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Rob Reiner's son Nick has been arrested and is being held on suspicion of murder after the director and his wife Michele were found dead in their home. But what's really got everyone talking is that Nick was last seen wearing a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt and pointing at his own face while shouting "That's me, dude!" as he made his way out of the house.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Nick was overheard arguing with his parents earlier in the day, but it wasn't about anything important like who ate the last donut or whose turn it was to do the dishes. No, this argument was about something much more serious... who got to control the remote at Netflix. "I'm not going to let him get away with watching The Great British Baking Show all day," Nick allegedly said, his voice filled with rage.<br/><br/>As police investigated the scene, they found a cryptic message scrawled on the wall in red ink: "You'll never take me alive... c'est la vie!" It's unclear what this message meant, but sources close to the investigation say it was likely just Nick trying to sound cooler by referencing a French film.<br/><br/>The Los Angeles Police Department has confirmed that Nick is being held without bail and that he will be presented in court on Tuesday. But when asked about the possible motives behind the murder, officials seemed stumped. "Well, we've ruled out any connection to Trump Derangement Syndrome... or at least, I think we have," said one police spokesperson.<br/><br/>As news of the arrest spread, celebrities took to social media to express their shock and outrage. "I'm horrified by this tragic event!" tweeted Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. "Who gets to control the remote at Netflix is not a life-or-death matter, folks!"<br/><br/>But not everyone was quick to condemn Nick. In fact, some were more sympathetic towards the young man. "We all know that family gatherings can be tough," said Justin Bieber in a statement. "And I'm pretty sure I've lost count of how many times my own family has gotten into a heated argument over who ate the last slice of pizza."<br/><br/>WHAT WE KNOW ABOUT NICK REINER, SON ARRESTED IN DEATH OF DIRECTOR ROB REINER<br/><br/>Nick Reiner is a 32-year-old film producer and son of director Rob Reiner. He's also known for his struggles with addiction and homelessness, which inspired the semi-autobiographical film Being Charlie that he made with his father in 2015.<br/><br/>In addition to being a talented filmmaker, Nick has also been an accomplished baker. Sources close to the family claim that he won first prize at the Los Angeles County Fair's pie-baking contest last year with his famous "Taco Pie" recipe.<br/><br/>Despite his many talents and accomplishments, Nick has always struggled with one major flaw: his love of bad puns. In fact, it was reportedly this very habit that led to the argument with his parents in the first place. "I told him, 'Nick, you can't just say that Dad's jokes are 'killer'... it's not funny anymore,'" said Michele Reiner in a statement.<br/><br/>ROB REINER: SIX CLASSIC MOVIES FROM THE 'BIG-HEARTED GENIUS' DIRECTOR<br/><br/>Rob Reiner was known for directing some of the most iconic films of our time, including When Harry Met Sally, This is Spinal Tap, and A Few Good Men. But few people know about his secret love of competitive knitting.<br/><br/>In fact, it's rumored that Rob was planning to retire from filmmaking and pursue a career in professional knitting when he passed away. His legacy lives on through his son Nick, who has vowed to carry on the family tradition of producing films... and baking pies.<br/><br/>HOLLYWOOD IN SHOCK AFTER DIRECTOR ROB REINER AND WIFE FOUND DEAD<br/><br/>As news of the tragedy spread, Hollywood was left reeling in shock. "I'm still trying to process what happened," said a visibly shaken Emma Stone. "I mean, who gets killed over Netflix? It's just not something you hear about every day."<br/><br/>Others were more stoic, like Meryl Streep, who simply stated, "It's just another reminder that life is short... and also really expensive if you're trying to afford tickets to all the latest Marvel movies."<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>The Los Angeles Police Department has announced that Nick Reiner will be charged with murder in connection with the deaths of his parents. In a surprise move, prosecutors have also filed charges against Nick's cat, Whiskers, for allegedly "aiding and abetting" in the crime.<br/><br/>When asked about the new development, Nick's lawyer simply shrugged and said, "Well, it looks like my client is going to need a better defense team... or maybe just a good therapist."</p>
