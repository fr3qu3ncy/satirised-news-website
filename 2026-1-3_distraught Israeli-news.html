        <p>BREAKING: The family who survived the Hamas attack in 2023 call the incident an “intrusion” - and they're not talking about their in-laws<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Israeli family who miraculously survived the Hamas attack on October 7, 2023, have come forward to describe the traumatic experience as nothing short of an "intrusion." And no, it wasn't just the pesky door-to-door salesman trying to sell them a timeshare. <br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was actually their neighbors), the family's home in Netiv HaAsara, Israel, was bombed by Hamas militants who were attempting to blow up their front door with explosives. Because, you know, that's exactly what you do when you're trying to make a point - just destroy someone's living room.<br/><br/>Tzeela Horenstein, the family matriarch, claimed that not only did they narrowly escape death at the hands of Hamas, but then they had to deal with an even bigger tragedy: a BBC news crew showing up uninvited and taking pictures of their traumatized kids without permission. We're talking about those pesky paparazzi - I mean, journalists.<br/><br/>"I was trying to process the trauma of almost being blown up by terrorists," said Tzeela, "and then these people show up with cameras and start snapping away like they were at a Kardashian family reunion." <br/><br/>The BBC, in a rare display of actual accountability (not that it's going to change anything), apologized for their actions and handed over a whopping £28,000 to the family as a " gesture of goodwill" - you know, like when your aunt gives you a check for $100 after you "accidentally" knocked over her vase.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was unavailable for comment, but sources close to him claim he's considering running for mayor of Gaza. Because, you know, that would be a real game-changer - and not at all like something out of an absurdist play. <br/><br/>In related news, Hamas has announced plans to start selling "I survived the BBC" t-shirts online, with proceeds going towards funding their next explosive device manufacturing facility.<br/><br/>Update: We've just received word that Elon Musk is looking to buy a stake in Hamas's PR department - because who wouldn't want to give the world the gift of Twitter-length apologies for genocidal acts?</p>
