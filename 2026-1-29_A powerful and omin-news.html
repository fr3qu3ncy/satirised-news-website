        <p>The European Union added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps to its terrorist list, but not before a series of absurd and chaotic events involving protests, tweets, nuclear war threats, and internet outages.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>EU Adds Iran's Revolutionary Guards to Terrorist List, But Not Before a Bunch of Other Stuff Happens<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the European Union (EU) has added Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) to its terrorist list. Because, you know, one more thing to worry about in our already chaotic lives.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (okay, it was just a guy on Twitter), this move is a response to Tehran's "deadly crackdown" on protesters. Who knew Iran had such a fondness for protests? It's like they were trying to be the ultimate reality TV show.<br/><br/>The EU's top diplomat, Kaja Kallas, said in a statement that "repression cannot go unanswered." Well, duh! Unless you're talking about your aunt's cooking, then repression is totally okay. In fact, it's encouraged.<br/><br/>To put things into perspective, Iran's IRGC has been compared to the Terminator - a relentless and efficient force that will stop at nothing to achieve its goals. Or, as I like to call them, "the Iranian Secret Service (ISS) for short".<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The US President, Donald Trump, chimed in with his own two cents, saying that Iran was on the brink of a nuclear war and that they should just come to the table already. Because, you know, nothing says "diplomacy" like a sternly-worded tweet.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Iranian authorities claimed that more than 3,100 people had been killed in the protests - all while the internet was down, because who needs connectivity when you're trying to crush a rebellion? I mean, it's not like everyone would just go on Twitter and Instagram and complain about how they can't access the internet. Nope.<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, Australia, Canada, and the US have already classified the IRGC as a terror group (yawn). But don't worry, UK Deputy Prime Minister David Lammy assured us all that it was just "long-standing government policy" not to comment on whether a specific organization is being considered for proscription. Yeah, because that makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>To cap it all off, the EU announced new sanctions on six entities and 15 individuals in Iran, including Interior Minister Eskandar Momeni - who's just trying to make a living, right? It's not like he's been involved in the violent repression of peaceful protests or anything. <br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! Iran's IRGC is now officially on the EU's terrorist list, and we're all just along for the ride.</p>
