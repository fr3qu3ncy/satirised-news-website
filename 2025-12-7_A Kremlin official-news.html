        <p>Breaking News: Kremlin Welcomes Trump's New Strategy with Open Arms (and a hint of sarcasm)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Kremlin has welcomed US President Donald Trump's new National Security Strategy with open arms, calling it "largely consistent" with Moscow's vision. Because who wouldn't want to be associated with a document that sounds like it was written by a 19th-century Russian aristocrat?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Kremlin (and by sources, we mean a guy named Boris who lives in a small flat above a fish market), the strategy is "a positive step" towards understanding the complexities of modern geopolitics. Or, you know, just a way for Putin to get his hands on some top-secret information about how to make the perfect borscht.<br/><br/>The document, which was unveiled by the US administration this week, suggests that Europe is facing "civilisational erasure" – a phrase that sounds suspiciously like something out of a bad sci-fi movie. It also doesn't cast Russia as a threat to the US, because who needs enemies when you have friends like Donald Trump?<br/><br/>Combatting foreign influence, ending mass migration (but only if they're not from countries with good football teams), and rejecting the EU's perceived practice of "censorship" are all mentioned as priorities in the report. Because, you know, nothing says "democracy" like a country that censors its citizens.<br/><br/>Several EU officials and analysts had pushed back on the strategy, questioning its focus on freedom of expression and likening it to language used by the Kremlin. But who needs freedom of expression when you have a president who thinks it's okay to tweet about your personal life at 3 am?<br/><br/>In related news, Vladimir Putin has been spotted wearing a "Make Europe Great Again" t-shirt, with the slogan emblazoned in bold letters across his chest. When asked for comment, he simply shrugged and said, "What can I say? It's a great design."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, former Swedish Prime Minister Carl Bildt wrote that the document "places itself to the right of the extreme right." To which we respond: well, at least it's consistent with Trump's policy of being consistently inconsistent.<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, a fully clothed woman was spotted sitting in a bathtub, surrounded by plants and an orange handbag hooked onto her ankle. When asked about the significance of this image, a spokesperson for the Kremlin simply said, "It's all just part of our new strategy to promote relaxation and wellness in international relations." Yeah, sure.<br/><br/>In related news:<br/><br/>* Trump has been spotted playing a game of chess with Putin, using only pieces made from Russian nesting dolls.<br/>* The US administration has announced plans to introduce a new currency, the "Trump Buck," which will be accepted at all major fast-food chains across Europe.<br/>* Boris Johnson has been seen sneaking into a secret underground bunker, where he's been practicing his best Trump impression in front of a mirror.</p>
