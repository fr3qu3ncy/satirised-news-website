        <p>BREAKING: Hundreds Dead, Scores of Kardashians Arrested as Iran Protests Turn Ugly<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the Iranian government's crackdown on anti-government protests has taken a surprising turn for the worse – literally. With over 500 people reportedly killed in two weeks of demonstrations, authorities have resorted to extreme measures to quell the uprising.<br/><br/>At the forefront of this chaos is Amir Mohammad Koohkan, a 26-year-old futsal coach and referee who was tragically shot dead by security forces while trying to score a goal for the protesters. "He was just doing his job," said a friend, who wished to remain anonymous due to fear of reprisal from the regime. "I mean, who doesn't love a good game of futsal?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre coincidence, Rubina Aminian, a 23-year-old student and self-proclaimed "fashionista," was also killed while participating in a protest. Eyewitnesses claim she was shot from behind by government forces while trying to take a selfie with a protest leader. Her uncle, who wished to remain incognito due to fear of being "Iran-napped" by the regime, said: "She fought for what she believed in – and also had an amazing sense of style."<br/><br/>As protests continue to rage across Iran, world leaders are weighing in on the situation. US President Donald Trump has taken to Twitter to threaten military intervention, while Iranian leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has accused protesters of being backed by the CIA... and Kanye West.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, sources close to the regime claim that hundreds of Kardashians have been arrested for "instigating unrest" and "wearing too much makeup." When asked for comment, Kim Kardashian's publicist responded: "Kim is totally unaware of any Kardashian involvement in Iranian protests. She's just trying to keep up with her skincare routine, okay?"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to spiral out of control, one thing is clear: Iran's protests have become a real-life episode of "The Hunger Games," with protesters being forced to wear ridiculous outfits and compete in death-match-style battles against government forces.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story – and remember, if you're ever in Iran, just stick to the futsal courts and avoid any protests at all costs.</p>
