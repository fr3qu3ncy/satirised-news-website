        <p>BREAKING: Iranian Protester Erfan Soltani Released on Bail, Reports Say... Sort Of<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, 26-year-old Iranian man Erfan Soltani was released on bail yesterday after being arrested in connection with anti-government protests last month. But don't get too excited, folks, because this is where things start to get weird.<br/><br/>According to Norway-based Kurdish human rights group Hengaw (yes, that's a real thing), Soltani was initially scheduled to be executed within days of his arrest. However, Iran's judiciary came out and said, "Hey, nope, he just faces security-related charges carrying prison terms only." Which is like saying, "Oh, you're going to jail for a few years, but also maybe not."<br/><br/>Soltani's lawyer, Amir Mousakhani (who sounds like a great guy, by the way), told AFP that his client was released on bail after a cool 2 billion tomans (that's around $12,600 or £9,200, just for context) was paid. Because, you know, money makes everything better.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Reports say Soltani received all of his belongings, including his cellphone, which is probably still got a few selfies from the protests on it. We're guessing he's going to be a little more careful with that phone now.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the real heroes here – the Iranian authorities who were so confident in their ability to execute Soltani within days of his arrest. I mean, who needs due process when you've got a death sentence waiting? That's just good old-fashioned authoritarianism at its finest.<br/><br/>And finally, we've got a special mention for US President Donald Trump, who earlier threatened to take "very strong action" if executions were carried out. Because, you know, that's exactly what the world needs – more Twitter rants from politicians.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks, because this is definitely going to be an interesting week in Iran... and possibly everywhere else, too.</p>
