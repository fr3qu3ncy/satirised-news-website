        <p>COMEDY VERSION OF THE NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>BREAKING: TRUMP TAKES OVER VENEZUELA, DECLARES HIMSELF "TOP COOK"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump has taken over Venezuela and declared himself the "Top Cook" of the country. The US President was seen sauntering into Caracas in his signature hairpiece, flanked by a entourage of confused-looking Secret Service agents.<br/><br/>"It's a tremendous honor to be taking over this beautiful country," Trump said in a statement, as he sniffed around the presidential palace for any signs of decent coffee. "And let me tell you, folks, I'm not just talking about the oil reserves – although those are pretty great too."<br/><br/>Sources close to the White House have confirmed that Trump's plan to "run" Venezuela involves implementing a new national pastime: competitive eating contests. The US President has reportedly decreed that every Friday will be "National Fry-Day," and all citizens are expected to turn up with their stretchy pants on.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, former Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro is currently being held in a secret location by the CIA, where he's allegedly undergoing intense interrogation techniques – including forced viewing of Trump's Twitter feed and mandatory attendance at WWE Smackdown events.<br/><br/>"Maduro is doing great," said a CIA spokesperson. "We've just convinced him that he's actually a 35-year-old man from Akron, Ohio, and not the President of Venezuela. It's all about perception, folks."<br/><br/>The US has also announced plans to establish a new national currency: the Dollarito. The new currency will feature Trump's face on one side, and a picture of himself holding a giant bucket of fried chicken on the other.<br/><br/>"We're really excited about this," said Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin. "And who knows? Maybe we'll even make Venezuela great again – in our own image, naturally."<br/><br/>As for Maria Corina Machado, the opposition leader Trump claimed didn't have the "support or respect" to take power, she's now running a successful food truck business outside the presidential palace, serving up authentic Venezuelan cuisine with a dash of Trump-style flair.<br/><br/>"It's all about branding," she said in an interview. "And let me tell you, folks – my empanadas are yuge."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates from this utterly ridiculous story!</p>
