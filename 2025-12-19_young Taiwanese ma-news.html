        <p>BREAKING: Taipei Metro Mayhem<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, a 27-year-old Taiwanese man named Chang Wen went on a rampage in the streets of Taipei, killing three people and injuring nine others with his trusty knife.<br/><br/>It all started when Wen set off a series of smoke bombs at Taipei's main metro station, causing chaos and panic among commuters. But this wasn't just any ordinary smoke bomb – oh no! These were fancy-schmancy smoke bombs that also released a faint scent of freshly baked croissants, making everyone's mouth water in anticipation of a mid-morning snack.<br/><br/>As people stumbled out of the metro station, Wen made his move, running towards another station nearby while wielding a large knife and wearing a baseball cap. It was like he had just stepped out of a 90s music video, complete with a flannel shirt and a Nirvana haircut.<br/><br/> Witnesses described the scene as "absolute pandemonium," with people running in all directions, tripping over each other, and shouting "What's going on? Why is there smoke everywhere?" Meanwhile, Wen continued to stab people at random, like he was playing a game of "dodge the knife" at a children's birthday party.<br/><br/>The suspect's next move was to run into a nearby bookshop and department store, where he proceeded to stab even more people. It was like he had a personal vendetta against readers and shoppers alike! One eyewitness said, "I was just browsing through the fiction section when suddenly this guy comes in, knife in hand, and starts stabbing people. I thought it was a promotional stunt for a new horror novel!"<br/><br/>But Wen's wild ride didn't end there. He then ran out of the store and back onto the streets, where he set off even more smoke bombs and continued to stab people. It was like he had a never-ending supply of knives and a strong dislike for humanity!<br/><br/>Finally, after what seemed like an eternity, Wen fell from a multi-storey building while trying to escape the police. As he lay there, dying, he muttered something about "the government being controlled by aliens" – which, let's be real, was probably just his way of saying "I'm just really disappointed in life."<br/><br/>The Taiwanese authorities have launched an investigation into Wen's motives, but sources close to the case say it's likely he just had a bad day and needed someone to take out his frustrations on.<br/><br/>In related news, sales of smoke bombs and knives are expected to skyrocket in the coming weeks as people stock up for their own mid-morning snack attacks.</p>
