        <p>The BBC's Russia Editor Speaks to People in the Country as the War in Ukraine Nears a Fourth Year (But Also Mentions Some Completely Irrelevant Stuff)<br/><br/>As the war in Ukraine approaches its fourth year, the BBC's Russia editor Steve Rosenberg took to the streets of Moscow to ask people about their hopes and dreams for 2026. But things quickly took a turn for the bizarre when he stumbled upon a group of pensioners playing bingo in a community center.<br/><br/>"I asked them what they were hoping for in 2026," said Rosenberg, "and one of them, Olga, replied that she was hoping to win the jackpot and buy a new vacuum cleaner. I mean, who doesn't want a new vacuum cleaner, right?"<br/><br/>But things only got weirder from there. As Rosenberg continued his reporting, he came across a group of cosplayers dressed as characters from "Game of Thrones." They were reenacting a scene from the show, but with a twist: they were all wearing matching "I'm with stupid" t-shirts.<br/><br/>"I asked them what they thought about the war in Ukraine," said Rosenberg, "and one of them, a guy named Vlad, replied that he was rooting for Team Daenerys. I think there may have been some confusion about the actual context of the conflict."<br/><br/>As the day went on, Rosenberg encountered even more strange and unexpected things. He saw a group of people doing the cha cha slide in a park, a street performer riding a unicycle while reciting the entire script of "Hamlet," and a group of seniors having a heated debate about whether pineapple belonged on pizza.<br/><br/>"I'm starting to think that Russians are just really passionate about their hobbies and interests," said Rosenberg. "I mean, who needs to talk about war and politics when you can discuss the finer points of competitive eating or the best way to cook a chicken?"<br/><br/>Despite the surreal nature of his reporting, Rosenberg still managed to squeeze in some actual news. He spoke with several people who expressed concerns about the state of Russia's economy, which is facing increasing pressure due to international sanctions.<br/><br/>"It seems like everyone I talked to was worried about the future," said Rosenberg. "But you know what? They were all pretty optimistic about it too. I mean, after all, as one person put it, 'What's the worst that could happen?'"<br/><br/>And so, with a healthy dose of skepticism and a dash of humor, Steve Rosenberg brought us back to reality (or at least, as much reality as you can expect in Moscow).<br/><br/>In other news...<br/><br/>* A group of sheep were spotted crossing a busy street in Nuremberg, Germany. When asked about their plans for 2026, one of the sheep replied that it was hoping to start a career as a professional snail trainer.<br/>* The French Resistance has announced its support for Team France in the upcoming Olympics. When asked about their strategy, a spokesperson replied that they were planning to "just wing it" and see what happens.<br/>* Pope Leo has released his Christmas message, in which he called for an end to conflicts around the world. When asked about his plans for 2026, he replied that he was hoping to start a new podcast about the history of baked goods.<br/><br/>And finally...<br/><br/>* In a bizarre incident, a fire broke out at a bar in Switzerland during New Year's Eve celebrations. Witnesses described the scene as " absolute chaos," with people running around and screaming while trying to escape the flames.<br/>* A group of Spanish food enthusiasts held an annual food fight festival, where they hurled flour and eggs at each other while dressed in medieval costumes.<br/>* Brigitte Bardot has passed away at the age of 91. When asked about her legacy, a spokesperson replied that she was "mostly known for being really pretty."</p>
