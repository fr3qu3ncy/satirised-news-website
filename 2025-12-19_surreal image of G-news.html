        <p>ISRAEL SAYS "NO WORRIES, MATES" AS GAZA HUNGER CRISIS CONTINUES<br/><br/>Israel's foreign ministry has responded to the latest report on the hunger crisis in Gaza by saying "don't worry about it, mate" and that everything is just hunky-dory. The Integrated Food Security Phase Classification (IPC) reported that half a million people - about a quarter of Gaza's population - still lived in areas suffering from famine conditions.<br/><br/>In related news, Gordon Ramsay has been hired to run the Gaza Strip's new food truck business, where he'll be serving up delicious burgers and sandwiches while simultaneously yelling at anyone who dares to disagree with his culinary methods. "Shut it down! Shut it all down!" Gordon was overheard shouting on more than one occasion.<br/><br/>The IPC report also noted that the number of trucks with food aid entering Gaza each week exceeded what the UN had determined it needed, but this is just a minor technicality, really. After all, who needs actual data and facts when you have Israel's Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu saying "don't worry about it" on Twitter?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it was revealed that the true cause of the hunger crisis in Gaza is actually due to a lack of pizza parties and adequate snack provisions. "It's a tragedy," said an unnamed Israeli official, while trying to stifle a giggle. "We had no idea that snacks were so important!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Elon Musk has announced plans to build a massive Tesla factory on the Gaza Strip, where he'll be producing enough batteries to power every household in the region... provided they're using the latest iPhone models and eating only organic, vegan food.<br/><br/>And in other news, it's been discovered that the entire UN-backed expert team monitoring the hunger crisis in Gaza was secretly made up of retired accountants from rural England. "We just wanted to get away from all the excitement," said one unnamed accountant, "and focus on our spreadsheets."<br/><br/>In response to these new developments, Israel's foreign ministry has released a statement saying "don't worry about it" and that everything will be fine... just as soon as they figure out how to make enough hummus to go around.</p>
