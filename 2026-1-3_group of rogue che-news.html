        <p>VENEZUELA DECLARES NATIONAL EMERGENCY, DENOUNCING "EXTREMELY SERIOUS MILITARY INVASION... OF MY GRANNY'S COOKBOOK"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuela has declared a national emergency after denouncing an "extremely serious military invasion" – but not the kind you'd expect. It turns out that the invading forces were actually a group of rogue chefs who had infiltrated the country's culinary scene with their evil plans to steal all the world's best recipes.<br/><br/>President Maduro, resplendent in his finest jumpsuit and sporting a haircut that defies gravity, took to the airwaves to address the nation. "My fellow Venezuelans," he declared, "we have been betrayed by a coterie of gastronomic terrorists who seek to impose their own brand of mediocrity on our great cuisine!"<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report that the invading chefs, led by the notorious Chef Jean-Claude Fournier, had set up a secret underground kitchen deep beneath the streets of Caracas. From this lair, they had been plotting the downfall of Venezuela's beloved dishes, including arepas stuffed with shredded chicken and avocado, and fried plantains smothered in melted cheese.<br/><br/>As the nation teeters on the brink of culinary disaster, Maduro has vowed to take drastic action to protect his country's gastronomic heritage. "We will not stand idly by while our national dish is reduced to a mere footnote in the annals of history!" he thundered.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, international leaders have rushed to Venezuela's aid, offering their support and expertise in the fight against these culinary marauders. The United States, for example, has pledged to send a team of top chefs to help the Venezuelan army track down and defeat the invading forces.<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, it's been revealed that Chef Fournier was once a key advisor to former US President Donald Trump on matters of international cuisine. Sources close to the White House have confirmed that Trump had been secretly backing the rogue chef's plans all along – but only because he wanted to get his hands on Venezuela's secret recipe for the world's best empanadas.<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is certain: the world will be watching with bated breath as Venezuela fights to preserve its culinary traditions and prevent a gastronomic catastrophe of epic proportions.</p>
