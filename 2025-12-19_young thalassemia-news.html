        <p>BREAKING: Thalassemia Kids Infected with HIV After Receiving Blood Transfusions from Elvis Presley's Estate<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, five children with thalassemia in Madhya Pradesh state have been left devastated after testing positive for HIV. And the reason behind this medical mayhem? It seems that these pint-sized patients received blood transfusions from none other than Elvis Presley's estate.<br/><br/>That's right, folks! The King himself donated his blood to help these young ones, and it appears that his generosity came with a hefty side of HIV. Authorities are stumped, wondering how the rockstar-turned-blood-donor could have been so careless with his bodily fluids.<br/><br/>"We're not sure how Elvis's blood ended up in our system," said Dr. Manoj Shukla, chief medical and health officer for Satna district. "But we do know that it was a real swingin' good time... until the kids got sick."<br/><br/>As news of this shocking scandal spreads, parents are up in arms, demanding answers from the state government. "How could they have given our children Elvis's blood without properly screening it?" asked one furious parent.<br/><br/>The families are now facing an uncertain future, with their children struggling to cope with not only thalassemia but also HIV. And if that wasn't enough, they're also dealing with a severe case of FOMO (fear of missing out) – on the latest Elvis Presley album releases.<br/><br/>Elvis's Estate: "We're Shocked and Scandalized"<br/><br/>In a statement released to the press, Elvis Presley's estate has expressed their deep regret over this unfortunate turn of events. "We had no idea that our beloved King's blood would be used for such nefarious purposes," said a spokesperson.<br/><br/>"We demand a full investigation into this matter and are calling on the state government to take immediate action to prevent any further 'Presley-itis' outbreaks."<br/><br/>A Message from the PM<br/><br/>Prime Minister Narendra Modi has issued a statement condemning the use of Elvis's blood in these medical procedures. "We must ensure that our children receive only the safest and most sanitized blood transfusions," he said.<br/><br/>"And if that means importing blood from outer space, so be it!"<br/><br/>As this shocking saga continues to unfold, one thing is certain: no parent will ever look at a blood transfusion the same way again.</p>
