        <p>BREAKING: Nigerian Schoolchildren Released, but Details are Hazy and 165 People Remain Unaccounted For<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left everyone scratching their heads, about 100 abducted schoolchildren were released in Nigeria yesterday. However, the details surrounding their release are as unclear as a Donald Trump tweet.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the children arrived at the Niger state capital, Minna, on a fleet of minibuses, escorted by military vans and armoured vehicles. The governor, Umar Bago, was there to greet them with a big smile and a "hakuna matata" attitude. But wait, what's this? No one knows how they were released or if any ransoms were paid! It's like trying to get a straight answer from a cat - impossible!<br/><br/>The rescued students will be reunited with their families at the school in Papiri, which is over 300km away from the state capital. One can only imagine the excitement and joy of seeing one's child after being held captive for so long. Or maybe not - who knows what kind of psychological trauma these kids have endured? <br/><br/>The governor of neighbouring Nasarawa state, Abdullahi Sule, claimed that the federal government played a key role in securing their release. But when asked to elaborate, he just shrugged and said "security reasons, my friend." Security reasons? Sounds like something a Bond villain would say! <br/><br/>And if you think this is all over, think again! About 153 students and 12 staff members are still missing, and no one knows what's happening to them. It's like they vanished into thin air - except for the armed gunmen, of course.<br/><br/>This incident has sparked concerns about the security crisis in Nigeria, which has seen numerous mass abductions and kidnappings recently. Schools and places of worship have been targeted, leaving many wondering if it's safe to send their kids to school anymore. Or if it's even safe to go to church on Sunday!<br/><br/>In related news, Nicki Minaj has come out in support of Trump's claim that Christians are being persecuted in Nigeria. Yeah, because nothing says "persecution" like a few dozen armed gunmen taking over a school! <br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this bizarre and confusing story, folks!</p>
