        <p>BREAKING: Burkina Faso's Junta Leader Accuses Ivory Coast of Funding Coup Plot<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Burkina Faso's military leader, Capt Ibrahim Traoré, has accused neighboring Ivory Coast of funding a plot to assassinate him. But wait, there's more! This isn't just any ordinary coup attempt - nope! It involves a cast of colorful characters, including Lt Col Paul Henri Damiba, the ousted military leader who's been practicing his best "I'm not a villain" face in front of the mirror.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Burkina Faso junta (and by "sources," I mean our team of highly trained hamsters), Damiba had planned to assassinate Traoré using a combination of stealth, cunning, and a dash of explosives. But just as they were about to put their diabolical plan into action, the authorities got wind of it and foiled the plot. Whoop-de-doo!<br/><br/>As if this weren't enough, we've learned that Damiba had enlisted the help of none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's stunt double from the movie Fast & Furious 7 (yes, you read that right). Apparently, The Rock's doppelganger was to be the getaway driver for the would-be assassins. Talk about a cameo!<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about Ivory Coast?" Ah, yes! It seems they've been playing the part of the Big Bad Wolf in all this, funding the coup plot and trying to stir up trouble in Burkina Faso. We can only assume that the Ivorians are secretly fans of the TV show Game of Thrones and wanted to recreate the epic Battle of King's Landing.<br/><br/>As a result of this foiled coup attempt, Traoré has declared a state of emergency and announced plans to build a wall around his palace (just like President Trump). He's also ordered an investigation into the "dastardly" plot, which will undoubtedly reveal all sorts of nefarious details about the plotters' evil schemes.<br/><br/>In related news, we've learned that the Burkina Faso junta has issued a warning to its citizens: "Do not be misled by naivety into dangerous schemes." Well, that's just plain silly. If you want to survive in Africa, you need to be more like Jean-Claude Van Damme - agile, quick-witted, and ready for anything.<br/><br/>There you have it, folks! Stay safe out there, and remember: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But if someone tries to kill you with explosives, just call the authorities (or Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson).</p>
