        <p>BREAKING: Rob Reiner's Son Nick Arrested for Murder After Director and Wife Found Dead<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the son of legendary director Rob Reiner has been arrested and charged with murder after his parents were found dead in their home on Sunday. But that's not all - things are about to get weird.<br/><br/>According to sources, 32-year-old Nick Reiner was taken into custody by the Los Angeles Police Department after a frantic Romy, the couple's 28-year-old daughter, called 911 to report finding her parents with multiple stab wounds in their Brentwood, California mansion. But here's the kicker: the police investigation has turned up some unexpected evidence.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Nick was last seen arguing with his father over who ate the last slice of pizza in the fridge. "It was a heated debate," said one witness. "Rob was like, 'I know I had it!' and Nick was all, 'No way, dude! It was me!'". Little did they know, this argument would be their final.<br/><br/>As police searched the mansion for clues, they stumbled upon an unusual item: a signed poster of The Fresh Prince of Bel-Air hanging in the living room. Sources say that Rob Reiner had autographed it with the phrase "To my favorite son, Nick (just kidding, Romy's still got this)".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump has weighed in on the situation, tweeting "Sad! Just heard about the tragic deaths of @robreiner and his wife. Reportedly died due to their massive, unyielding, and incurable affliction with #TrumpDerangementSyndrome". We're not sure what reports he's referring to, but we do know that Rob Reiner was a vocal critic of Trump.<br/><br/>The investigation continues, but one thing is clear: this case has all the makings of a Hollywood blockbuster. And in related news, the LAPD has issued a statement saying they are "on the hunt" for Nick's missing PlayStation 4 controller.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, sources close to the investigation have revealed that Nick Reiner was heard yelling "I'm not going down without a fight!" as he was being taken away in handcuffs. Witnesses claim that he also shouted "Someone's gotta pay for my student loans!"<br/><br/>As the news spreads like wildfire across social media, fans of Rob Reiner are taking to Twitter to express their shock and sadness. #RobReinerForever is trending, with many users paying tribute to his iconic films and legacy.<br/><br/>But not everyone is feeling the love. President Trump has tweeted again, this time saying "Fake news! I'm the one who's been stabbed in the back by @robreiner's family. Sad!"<br/><br/>In a statement, Nick Reiner's lawyer said that their client was "cooperating fully with the authorities and will plead his case in court". We can only imagine what that courtroom drama is going to be like.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>BREAKING UPDATE<br/><br/>We've just received word from the LAPD that Nick Reiner's phone has been seized as part of the investigation. Sources claim that a suspicious text message was discovered, which read "Can't wait for Game 7 of the Lakers vs. Clippers game tonight! Bring it on, Bugsy!"<br/><br/>It seems like we're in for a wild ride with this case.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>FINAL UPDATE<br/><br/>And finally, in the most unexpected turn of events yet, Nick Reiner's lawyer has released a statement saying that their client will be pleading insanity as his defense strategy. "We believe that our client was driven to madness by the sheer excitement of watching the Lakers vs. Clippers game on TV," said the lawyer.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Bugs Bunny replied "What's up, doc? I had nothing to do with it!"<br/><br/>And that's a wrap, folks! Stay tuned for more updates from this totally-not-made-up news story...</p>
