        <p>BREAKING: Bondi Beach Carnage!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, at least 15 people were confirmed dead in Sunday's shooting attack at Bondi Beach, including two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor, and a 10-year-old girl who was secretly training to become the world's youngest professional snail trainer.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses described the scene as "absolute pandemonium," with people running for their lives while trying to take selfies with the Bondi Icebergs Rugby Club team in the background. One witness, a local pizza delivery guy, said he saw the alleged gunman, who was later revealed to be a disgruntled ex-boyfriend of a former Miss Australia winner, shouting "You'll never get my nachos!" as he fired his gun.<br/><br/>MATILDA, THE 10-YEAR-OLD SNAIL TRAINING WHIZ<br/><br/>Ten-year-old Matilda, who was described by her family as a bright and joyful child, was among the victims. Her parents were seen holding up a sign that read "Matilda loved snails" as they attended a vigil on Tuesday to honor their daughter's memory.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the family, Matilda had been secretly training with her pet snail, Gary, for over two years to become the world's youngest professional snail trainer. Tragically, Gary was not present at the beach that day and is still missing, sparking fears of a possible snail-related crisis.<br/><br/>RABBI ELI SCHLANGER: THE BONDI RABBI<br/><br/>One of the key organizers of Sunday's event, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, 41, was known as the "Bondi Rabbi" for his exceptional ability to make latkes appear out of thin air. A British-born father of five, he leaves behind a wife and young children, including one who is still learning how to say "chai" without getting confused with "cheese."<br/><br/>Rabbi Schlanger's funeral will take place on Wednesday, and it's expected that his eulogy will be delivered by none other than the Prime Minister himself, who will also present a special award for "Most Likely to Make You Cry."<br/><br/>DAN ELKAYAM: THE FRENCH IT ANALYST WITH A SECRET PASSION FOR BONGO DRUMMING<br/><br/>Dan Elkayam, a French national who worked as an IT analyst for NBCUniversal, was confirmed dead by France's Foreign Minister. However, sources close to the family revealed that Dan had a secret passion for bongo drumming and was planning to release his debut album, "Bondi Beach Boogie," just days after the shooting.<br/><br/>The album cover art, which features Dan posing in front of a Bondi Beach sunset with a pair of sunglasses and a fedora, is expected to be released on streaming platforms next week. Proceeds from the sales will go towards funding a new snail sanctuary in Matilda's memory.<br/><br/>ALEXANDER KLEYTMAN: THE HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR WHO DIED SAVING HIS WIFE<br/><br/>Alexander Kleytman, 72, was a Holocaust survivor who came to Australia from Ukraine. According to his wife, Larisa, Alexander died shielding her from the gunman's bullets, saving her life in the process.<br/><br/>Larisa was seen sobbing uncontrollably as she told reporters that Alexander was an "angel" and that she would never forget the way he pushed his body up to stay near her during the attack. The couple's two children and 11 grandchildren are still trying to come to terms with their loss, while also planning a surprise birthday party for Larisa next week.<br/><br/>And so, as the people of Bondi Beach continue to mourn their loved ones, they cannot help but wonder what other secrets were hidden beneath the surface of this seemingly idyllic coastal town. Will we ever know the truth about Gary the snail? Only time will tell.</p>
