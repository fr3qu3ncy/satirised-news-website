        <p>BREAKING: Chaos Ensues as ICE Agent Films Self-Defense Against Crazy Cat Lady<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a video has emerged showing the heated moments before gunfire rang out on a Minneapolis street. The footage, taken by an Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent, reveals the chaotic scene as Renee Nicole Good, a 37-year-old woman with a penchant for knitting cat sweaters, refuses to move her car.<br/><br/>The clip starts with the ICE agent, clad in a bright orange jumpsuit and a "Don't Tread on Me" hat, approaching Good's vehicle while filming with his phone. Good, who appears to be sipping on a Starbucks coffee, calmly tells the agent, "That's fine dude. I'm not mad at you." Her wife, Becca, stands nearby, furiously typing away on her iPhone.<br/><br/>Things take a turn for the worse when the ICE agent demands that Good get out of her car. Good, who has apparently been practicing her driving skills in the DMV video game, decides to make a break for it – but not before telling the agent, "Do you want to come at us? I say go and get yourself some lunch, big boy." The agent, taken aback by Good's sass, responds with an expletive as he orders her to exit the vehicle.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Good proceeds to drive her car in reverse while simultaneously making a sandwich. The ICE agent, clearly frustrated, yells, "Woah, woah!" just before gunfire erupts. The video ends with Good's car careening down the street, leaving a trail of destruction in its wake.<br/><br/>The incident has sparked widespread protests across the US, with many calling for greater accountability from ICE agents and improved training on how to deal with feisty cat ladies.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In response to the backlash, Vice-President JD Vance took to social media to defend the ICE agent's actions, saying, "The reality is that his life was endangered and he fired in self-defence... and also, can someone please tell me where I got this stupid orange jumpsuit?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Good's wife, Becca, has released a statement paying tribute to her late partner, saying, "We had whistles... they had guns. We were just trying to support our neighbors when Renee was tragically taken from us." She added, "Renee loved cats almost as much as she loved being dramatic on Facebook."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
