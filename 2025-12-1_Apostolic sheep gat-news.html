        <p>**BREAKING: Greece on Brink of Feta Cheese Armageddon as Pox Pandemonium Wreaks Havoc**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Greece has been plagued by a mysterious outbreak of sheep and goat pox, leaving thousands of farmers in a state of utter despair. As the nation teeters on the edge of feta cheese collapse, the world is left wondering: how did it come to this?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Ministry of Rural Development and Food (or as we like to call it, "The Department of Not Having Enough Feta"), the first cases of pox were detected in northern Greece in August 2024. And let me tell you, it's been a wild ride ever since.<br/><br/>**"It's Like a Zombie Apocalypse Out Here!"**<br/><br/>Farmer Anastasia Siourtou, who lost her entire herd of 650 sheep to the pox, described the scene as "like something out of a horror movie." She continued, "I was here the day the sheep were culled. It was like they all just... disappeared. I felt like I was in a bad rom-com, but instead of a breakup, it was a biosecurity breach."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Tassos Manakas, another sheep farmer, is still reeling from the loss of his 873-strong herd. When asked how he's coping, he simply shrugged and said, "I'm just sitting here, eating my feelings. And also some feta cheese. Because, priorities."<br/><br/>**The Feta Cheese Shortage: A Tragedy for Humanity**<br/><br/>As the pox pandemic continues to ravage the countryside, experts warn that the shortage of sheep's milk may lead to a catastrophic collapse of the global feta cheese market. I mean, can you imagine a world without feta? It's like a nightmare come true.<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! The Greek government is taking steps to mitigate the crisis. According to sources, they've established a National Scientific Committee for the Management and Control of Sheep and Goat Pox (try saying that three times fast). And by "taking steps," I mean they're basically just shrugging and hoping it goes away.<br/><br/>**The People Demand Vaccination... and Also Some Feta**<br/><br/>As the nation descends into chaos, sheep and goat farmers are calling for mass vaccination of their herds. Because, you know, a little bit of science never hurt anyone (except maybe the pox itself).<br/><br/>And let's be real, folks: if Bulgaria and Turkey can do it, why can't Greece? I mean, we've got some of the best sheep-herding experts in the business over there (okay, maybe not the best, but we'll get to that later). But seriously, a little bit of vaccination magic could go a long way in saving our beloved feta cheese.<br/><br/>**The Bottom Line: Feta Cheese = Life**<br/><br/>In conclusion, Greece is on the brink of disaster. The pox pandemic has taken its toll, and the nation's most precious resource – feta cheese – is at risk of disappearing forever. But fear not, dear reader! For we'll keep you updated on this developing crisis... or until someone runs out of feta to snack on.<br/><br/>Stay vigilant, world!</p>
