        <p>BREAKING: Pope Francis, Ozzy Osbourne, and Diane Keaton Among Those Who Died This Year... But Not Really<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it's been revealed that Pope Francis, Ozzy Osbourne, and Diane Keaton have all passed away this year. But wait, there's more! They're not actually dead at all.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Vatican (who are clearly mistaken), Pope Francis died suddenly while enjoying a game of bingo with his pals. "It was a real nail-biter," said one eyewitness. "He got so excited when he won a round that he jumped up and did the chicken dance, but then he tripped on his own feet and face-planted into a plate of spaghetti."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ozzy Osbourne (who's actually still rocking to the tune of "Crazy Train") was reported to have died in a freak accident involving a hot tub and a can of beer. However, it turns out that he was just taking a break from his grueling tour schedule to soak up some sun and enjoy a cold one.<br/><br/>And as for Diane Keaton (who's still going strong with her latest film project), she allegedly died after accidentally supergluing her shoes to the floor during a critical scene in a movie. But don't worry, it was all just a clever ruse to get out of filming for the day.<br/><br/>Other notable "deaths" include:<br/><br/>* Robert Redford, who's actually still making movies and looking fabulous at 85.<br/>* Prunella Scales, who's not dead but just really tired after working on that pesky sitcom Fawlty Towers all those years ago.<br/>* David Lynch, who's not deceased but merely suffering from a bad case of creative block (it happens to the best of them).<br/>* Malcolm-Jamal Warner, who's actually still starring in TV shows and movies, but just really good at keeping a low profile.<br/><br/>And finally, Gene Hackman, who's not dead either but just enjoying an extended vacation on a deserted island where he can be alone with his thoughts (and a few bottles of fine scotch).<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. Pope Francis, Ozzy Osbourne, and Diane Keaton are all very much alive and kicking – or at least, that's what we've been told.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, a spokesperson for the BBC has issued a statement saying that this article is entirely fictional and not based on any actual events. But let's be real, folks, we're not buying it.</p>
