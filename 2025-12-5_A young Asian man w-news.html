        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>Hong Kong Authorities Arrest Petition Organizer for Demanding Answers After Deadly Fire, Sparking Public Outrage and Meme Fest.<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Miles Kwan, a university student and amateur DJ, was detained by Hong Kong authorities after launching a petition demanding answers from the government following one of the city's deadliest fires. Because, you know, what's more logical than arresting someone for asking questions when there are still 159 people missing and presumed dead?<br/><br/>The fire, which ravaged a densely populated housing estate in the northern Tai Po district, was so fierce that it could be seen from space – or at least, that's what we're told. As public anger grew, authorities warned against attempts to "exploit" the fire to "endanger national security." Which is code for: "Don't ask too many questions, or you'll get in trouble."<br/><br/>Kwan's petition, which listed "four demands" – echoing the "five demands, not one less" slogan that rallied protesters in 2019 – gathered more than 10,000 signatures in less than a day. But who needs that many people demanding answers when you can just arrest someone for asking?<br/><br/> Authorities are now investigating Kwan on suspicion of sedition, which is a fancy way of saying "they're trying to silence him." Meanwhile, the government has promised to support victims and investigate the blaze – but only after they've had a chance to review all the paperwork.<br/><br/>As the people of Hong Kong took to social media to express their outrage and confusion, one Twitter user quipped: "Demanding the truth is considered incitement? Sounds like something the Ministry of Truth would say in 1984."<br/><br/>In related news, John Lee, Hong Kong's chief executive, was spotted trying to do a backflip at a press conference this week. Witnesses claim he shouted, "I'll make sure justice is served!" before face-planting into a pile of paperwork.<br/><br/>Regina Ip, another Hong Kong lawmaker, defended the arrests by saying that authorities are being "extra careful" not to let public anger get out of hand – because nothing says "careful" like arresting someone for asking questions.<br/><br/>When asked about the incident, a spokesperson for the government said, "We're just trying to protect rule of law in a testing moment for the city." Translation: "We're scared of what might happen if we don't silence this guy."<br/><br/>The hashtag #JusticeForKwan began trending on social media, with many calling for the release of the petition organizer. Meanwhile, Kwan's Facebook profile picture was replaced with a meme of him wearing a pair of Groucho Marx glasses and holding a sign that reads: "I'm not just asking questions – I'm getting answers."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story. Or don't, because who needs to know what's going on in Hong Kong anyway?</p>
