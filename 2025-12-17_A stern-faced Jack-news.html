        <p>THE COMEDY NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>HEADLINE: Jack Smith's Trump Investigations: The Saga of the Special Counsel and the President Who Refused to Read His Email<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former US Special Counsel Jack Smith has found himself in the hot seat, facing questions about his two defunct criminal investigations into President Donald Trump. Because, let's be real, what's more exciting than a good ol' fashioned witch hunt?<br/><br/>As reported by our trusty sources (okay, fine, it was just me and my cat, Mr. Whiskers), Smith appeared on Capitol Hill to testify about his findings, which were basically just a series of "he said, she said" exchanges with Trump's lawyers.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (aka me again, and also a guy who looked suspiciously like a Pokémon character), Smith told Congress that his team had "developed proof beyond a reasonable doubt" that Trump was involved in some shady dealings. But let's be real, folks, we all know what really happened: Trump just got bored with the whole thing and decided to play some video games instead.<br/><br/>House Judiciary Chairman Jim Jordan, a staunch Trump ally (and also someone who looks eerily similar to the villain from that one 80s movie), called Smith's investigations "partisan and politically motivated." To which we say, "Duh, Jim! You're just mad because Trump didn't invite you to his next golf game."<br/><br/>The stakes are high for Smith, who Trump has deemed a "criminal" (yawn) and suggested should be "investigated and put in prison" along with other Department of Justice officials involved in the 2020 election inquiry. In other words, Trump is just mad because he got outsmarted by a guy with a better haircut.<br/><br/>In related news, Tom Hanks has been spotted on Capitol Hill, looking concerned about the whole ordeal. When asked for comment, he simply shook his head and muttered, "I don't know what to say, folks... it's like they're trying to make a movie out of this thing!"<br/><br/>SPECIAL REPORT: What's Next for Jack Smith?<br/><br/>Well, rumor has it that Smith is planning to release a tell-all book about the whole ordeal. Titled "The Trump Who Loved Me (Not Really)," it promises to be a thrilling tale of espionage, politics, and cat pictures.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! It's going to be a wild ride.<br/><br/>SIDEBAR: Why Does Donald Trump Hate Cucumbers?<br/><br/>Experts say it's because cucumbers are just too "cucumber-y" for him. But honestly, we're still trying to figure out why he thinks pineapple belongs on pizza.<br/><br/>FINAL THOUGHTS:<br/><br/>And there you have it, folks! The latest installment in the epic saga of Jack Smith vs. Donald Trump. Stay tuned for more updates, and don't forget to follow us on social media for even more ridiculous commentary!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>(Note: This is a work of satire and not meant to be taken seriously. Or is it?)</p>
