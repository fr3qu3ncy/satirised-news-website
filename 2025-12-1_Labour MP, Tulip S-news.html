        <p>**BANGLADESH'S SIDDIQ SENTENCED TO 2 YEARS IN PRISON... BUT SHE'S NOT GOING ANYWHERE!**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Labour MP Tulip Siddiq has been sentenced to two years in prison for corruption allegations in Bangladesh. But don't worry, she's not exactly sweating it - after all, she's still got her Labour Party membership and the whip in the House of Commons.<br/><br/>Siddiq, who is based in London and has rejected the charges, was found guilty of influencing her aunt, Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, to secure a plot of land for her family. But according to sources close to the MP, she's been too busy enjoying a spot of tea and crumpets at the Houses of Parliament to even notice.<br/><br/>"I'm absolutely baffled by the whole thing," said Siddiq, in a statement that was entirely believable but completely fabricated. "I've still had no contact whatsoever from the Bangladeshi authorities despite them spreading malicious allegations about me for a year-and-a-half now."<br/><br/>The Labour MP claimed she had engaged lawyers in the UK and Bangladesh to defend her against the charges, but it's not like she's been hiding or anything. In fact, she's been spotted at numerous high-profile events, including a recent appearance on "I'm a Celebrity... Get Me Out of Here!" where she was shown to be completely unfazed by the prospect of being eaten alive by a swarm of hungry jungle critters.<br/><br/>Siddiq's lawyers have disputed her status as a Bangladeshi citizen, citing the fact that she has never had an ID card or voter ID and hasn't held a passport since she was a child. But hey, who needs to follow the rules when you're a Labour MP with connections?<br/><br/>The verdict comes two weeks after Hasina was sentenced to death in a separate trial over her role in a brutal crackdown against protests that ultimately forced her from office. Because what's a little thing like human rights and due process when there are politics at play?<br/><br/>Siddiq continues to face numerous outstanding charges, including two ongoing trials related to the allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict. But don't worry, she's got a team of top lawyers on it... or not.<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** In response to the latest verdict, the Awami League has described it as "entirely predictable" and "firmly denied" the allegations against Hasina and her family members. Because who needs facts when you've got spin?</p>
