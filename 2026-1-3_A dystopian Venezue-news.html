        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela Captured, Donald Trump Declares "Operation Absolute Resolve"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro was captured by US forces on Saturday morning. But that's not all - in a bizarre press conference, US President Donald Trump declared the US would be taking control of Venezuela until they can figure out what to do next.<br/><br/>"It's going to be tremendous," Trump said, wearing a pair of shiny gold sunglasses and a "Make Venezuela Great Again" hat. "We're going to run the country until we can get a safe and proper transition... or not. You know, just wing it."<br/><br/>Trump claimed that Maduro was taken into custody by the US military's top counter-terrorism unit - the Delta Force - after a series of explosions rocked the capital city of Caracas. The explosions were reportedly caused by a group of rogue accountants who had been hired to fix Venezuela's financial woes but ended up causing chaos instead.<br/><br/>"I watched it live on TV," Trump said, nodding confidently. "It was like a movie, folks. A real thrill ride."<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Maduro was taken into custody while trying to escape in a souped-up DeLorean with flashing lights and a built-in espresso machine. He was wearing a blindfold and headphones, listening to Barry Manilow's greatest hits.<br/><br/>Venezuela's Vice-President Delcy Rodríguez called for calm and unity after the capture, saying that Maduro was the "only president" and that Venezuela would never be a colony of any nation. But Trump wasn't having it.<br/><br/>"She doesn't have a choice," he said, wagging his finger. "We're going to make Venezuela great again... or at least, we'll try."<br/><br/>Trump also announced plans for American oil companies to move into the country and start making money off Venezuela's rich natural resources. Because, you know, that's exactly what they needed - more oil.<br/><br/>"María Corina Machado is not a real person," Trump said when asked about Venezuela's opposition leader. "I mean, I've never heard of her. Sounds like a made-up name to me."<br/><br/>The United Nations has issued a statement calling for calm and urging both sides to engage in diplomatic talks... or at least, to send each other nice birthday cards.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>* Maduro's wife has been charged with being an accomplice to his crime of trying to escape from the US military.<br/>* The Delta Force is now offering a reward for any information leading to the capture of rogue accountants who caused the explosions in Caracas.<br/>* Trump has announced plans to build a wall around Venezuela... but not to keep people out, just to make sure they can't leave.<br/><br/>Stay classy, folks!</p>
