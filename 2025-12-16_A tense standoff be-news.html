        <p>BREAKING: US Accuses Rwanda of Being Bad at Making Friends, Breaching Deal Brokered by President Trump<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has accused Rwanda of being, well, pretty bad at keeping their promises. It turns out that President Paul Kagame and his team of Rwandan negotiators didn't quite live up to the "historic" peace deal they signed with Donald Trump last month.<br/><br/>The drama unfolded when rebel forces captured a key city in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC), causing President Trump to throw his hands up in the air and shout, "Not on my watch, folks! Not on my watch!" The rebels, backed by Rwanda, had allegedly breached a peace deal brokered by Mr. Trump himself, which was meant to bring stability to the region.<br/><br/>The US government claimed that the M23 rebel group, with its fancy name and questionable morals, was being backed by none other than Rwanda itself! Now, we all know that Rwanda is like the cool kid on the African block, but it seems they've been playing a little too loose with their friends in this case.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (aka my buddy Bob who works in the State Department), President Kagame was like, "Who, me? Back rebels? Never! I'm all about peace and stability... unless there's money involved, then I'm all about that life!"<br/><br/>The US Secretary of State, Marco Rubio, was quick to respond with a statement saying, "We take these allegations very seriously. We're not just talking about a breach of contract here; we're talking about a breach of trust, a betrayal of the American people's faith in our leaders... and also possibly some money that was supposed to be exchanged hands."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Rwanda, President Kagame was like, "What? No, no, no! We didn't do anything wrong! We're just trying to help our friends in the DRC achieve peace and stability... with a side of mineral wealth, of course!"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: this is not your average Tuesday. The world is holding its breath as we wait for the next move from the Rwandan government, and also hoping that someone will finally figure out how to make peace deals stick.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! It's going to be a wild ride!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Update: We've just received word that the rebels have agreed to withdraw from the key city at the request of the US. But wait, there's more! They're also demanding a "neutral force" be deployed to monitor a ceasefire and prevent the DRC army from regaining control of lost territory. Because, you know, that's exactly what we need: another layer of bureaucracy to complicate things.<br/><br/>And in other news, President Trump has been spotted tweeting, "Just made a fantastic deal with the rebels! They're going to withdraw and everything will be okay... trust me."</p>
