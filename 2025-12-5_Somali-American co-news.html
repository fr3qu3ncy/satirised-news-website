        <p>"Somali-Americans Are Freaking Out: Trump's 'Garbage' Comments Have Them Scared, Worried, and Possibly Planning a Dance Party to Take Their Minds Off It All"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Somali-Americans in Minnesota have revealed that they're absolutely terrified after US President Donald Trump intensified his criticism of the community this week. Community leaders told the BBC that the "apprehension is palpable" – which, let's be real, is just code for "we're all freaking out and wondering what we did wrong".<br/><br/>Aj Awed, executive director of the Cedar-Riverside Community Council (which represents a town known as Little Mogadishu for its large Somali population), said that Trump's comments were "dangerous" – which, in this context, means "made him drink an entire bottle of hot sauce while watching a Justin Bieber music video".<br/><br/>"We're not just worried about the enforcement operation targeting undocumented immigrants," Awed said. "We're also concerned about the impact on our annual event scheduled for next week. You know, the one where we all wear funny hats and eat too much falafel? Yeah, that one."<br/><br/>Trump made disparaging comments criticizing the Somali community at the White House on Tuesday, saying he didn't want them in the US and that their country was "no good for a reason" – which, let's be real, is just code for "I have no idea what I'm talking about, but I'll say something inflammatory anyway".<br/><br/>Mr. Awed also expressed concerns of violence that could follow Trump's comments. "When the president puts a bull's eye on the immigrant community here", he said, "that could encourage others to become 'more radicalised' – or, in this case, more likely to join a Pokémon Go raid and fight for the best Snorlax spot".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jamal Osman, a member of the Minneapolis City Council, moved to the US when he was 14 and is a naturalized citizen. "Anyone who looks like me [is] scared right now," he told CBS News – which, let's be real, is just code for "I'm terrified that Trump will start tweeting about my mom's cooking and claim it's the worst thing he's ever tasted".<br/><br/>The community is also bracing itself for increased immigration enforcement. One organization, Monarca, has scheduled "legal observer training" in Minneapolis to educate people on their rights when witnessing federal immigration activity – which, let's be real, means they'll just be standing around with clipboards and looking like a bunch of accountants at a convention.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Somali-Americans are freaking out because Trump's comments have them scared, worried, and possibly planning a dance party to take their minds off it all. As one community leader said, "We're not going to let Trump bring us down – we'll just put on some Beyoncé and shake our booties like nobody's business!"</p>
