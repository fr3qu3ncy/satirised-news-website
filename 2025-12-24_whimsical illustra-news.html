        <p>HO HO NO! SANTA PULLED OVER FOR SPEEDING IN OHIO<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left everyone in the holiday spirit, Santa Claus was pulled over for speeding through Fulton County, Ohio on Saturday. Yes, you read that right - Santa Claus, the jolly old man himself, was issued a friendly reminder to slow down by a sheriff.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Mrs. Claus was riding shotgun with Santa when they were pulled over, and according to eyewitnesses, she was heard saying "Oh dear, I told him to slow down!" in a voice that sounded suspiciously like... well, Mrs. Claus.<br/><br/>The sheriff, who wished to remain anonymous (but we're pretty sure it was Joe Exotic), said "No coal was issued - just a friendly reminder that even sleighs need to slow down." We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that Santa got pulled over or that he didn't have any coal on him.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! As Santa and Mrs. Claus were getting their ticket, a group of elves suddenly appeared out of nowhere, singing "Jingle Bells" at the top of their lungs. It was like they had been planning this whole thing for months - and honestly, we're not entirely sure if they were in on it or just really into Christmas carols.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a mariachi band that was passing by stopped to watch the commotion, and one of them shouted "¡Ay caramba!" while another one started playing a lively tune on his guitar. It was like a holiday party had erupted right there on the side of the road!<br/><br/>As for Santa, he took the whole thing in stride, saying "Ho ho ho! I guess I got a little carried away with the whole 'flying around the world in one night' thing." We're pretty sure that's code for "I was speeding and didn't even notice."<br/><br/>In any case, it looks like Santa will be getting his license back - after all, who can resist that jolly old face? And Mrs. Claus is already planning their next road trip...</p>
