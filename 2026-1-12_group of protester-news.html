        <p>"PROTESTS TURN INTO CHAOS, TEENAGERS SING 'I WILL SURVIVE' WHILE SECURITY FORCES DANCE THE MACARENA"<br/><br/>Tehran, Iran - Eyewitness accounts have emerged of security forces descending upon anti-government protesters like a swarm of angry bees, armed with Kalashnikovs and an endless supply of questionable disco dance moves. It's chaos, folks! <br/><br/>Eyewitness Omid, who has been protesting on the streets for days against economic hardship, described the scene as " absolute pandemonium". "They fired directly into lines of protesters, and people fell where they stood," he said, adding that the security forces were all wearing bright orange jumpsuits and had a serious case of the disco fever. "I swear, I saw one of them do the Macarena with a tear gas canister in hand - it was like something out of a bad 80s music video."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last shah of Iran, has been calling for people to join the protests. "I'm not sure what's going on, but I think he's trying to get everyone to sing 'I Will Survive' at the top of their lungs," said a young woman from Tehran. "It's like they're trying to create some sort of epic disco dance battle. Meanwhile, we're over here getting shot and killed - priorities, people!"<br/><br/>Tensions escalated on Friday when security forces suddenly attacked protesters in Fardis, a city just west of Tehran. Witnesses reported that members of the paramilitary Basij force fired live ammunition directly at protesters while riding motorcycles. "It was like they were trying to get the perfect shot for their Instagram stories," said one witness. Unmarked cars also drove into alleys and started blasting Celine Dion's 'My Heart Will Go On' on repeat, further confusing and terrifying the protesters.<br/><br/>The BBC has received similar accounts of the crackdown by security forces following the widespread protests across the country last week. Since then, internet access has been cut by the authorities, making reporting from Iran more difficult than ever - or at least, that's what they keep telling us. In reality, it's just a fancy excuse to get everyone to watch cat videos on YouTube instead.<br/><br/>As international news outlets struggle to verify the number of deaths among protesters, Iranian authorities are quick to point out that 100 security personnel have been killed during the protests. "That's nothing," said Omid, shaking his head. "We've got like, a million selfies taken with us being shot and stuff - it's just Tuesday for us."<br/><br/>UPDATE: In an unexpected turn of events, Iranian authorities have announced that they will be hosting a nationwide disco dance competition to distract from the chaos on the streets. Participants are encouraged to wear bright orange jumpsuits and show off their best Macarena moves while clutching tear gas canisters. The winner will receive a free trip to Dubai and a lifetime supply of falafel.<br/><br/>Disclaimer: This article has been entirely fabricated for comedic purposes. Any resemblance to actual events is purely coincidental, unless you're actually living in Iran - in which case, good luck and stay safe, mate!</p>
