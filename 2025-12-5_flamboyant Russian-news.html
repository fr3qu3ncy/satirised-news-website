        <p>BREAKING: Putin Threatens to Invade Donbas with Disco Ball, While Trump Negotiates a Deal with Putin's Secret BFF - the Chimp<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian leader Vladimir Putin has announced that he will invade the Donbas region using nothing but his disco ball and a pair of platform shoes. The move comes as US negotiators, led by Donald Trump, are set to meet Ukrainian officials in Florida to discuss a peace plan.<br/><br/>"I've got a deal that's gonna be yuge, just yuge," said Trump, flanked by his trusty sidekick Steve Witkoff and a chimpanzee named Bongo, who is rumored to be Putin's secret BFF. "We're gonna make Ukraine great again, believe me."<br/><br/>But not everyone is convinced that the deal will stick. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding any territory, saying, "Sorry, Vlad, but we're not giving up our land for a pair of sparkly shoes and a good time on the dance floor."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Putin's comments have been met with widespread skepticism by world leaders, who are demanding that he put down his disco ball and get serious about peace talks. French President Emmanuel Macron was overheard saying, "Mon dieu, Putin, you can't just threaten to invade someone with a pair of shoes! That's not diplomacy, that's just ridiculous."<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, it's been revealed that Bongo the chimpanzee has been secretly advising Putin on his negotiating strategy. When asked about the chimp's involvement, Witkoff simply shrugged and said, "Hey, Bongo's got some great ideas - and he's really good at making deals with bananas."<br/><br/>As tensions continue to rise, one thing is clear: only time will tell if this peace plan will stick or if it'll all come crashing down like a disco ball dropped on the dance floor.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a shocking move, Putin has announced that he's ditched his plans to invade Donbas and instead will be opening a chain of disco-themed restaurants across Russia. "I'm all about the vibes," said Putin, flashing a cheesy grin. "And who needs war when you can have dance floors and polyester suits?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story - or not, because honestly, it's getting pretty ridiculous around here.</p>
