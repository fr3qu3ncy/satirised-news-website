        <p>BREAKING: Israel and US Launch Surprise Attack on Iran, Citing "Pre-emptive" Necessity<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Israel and the United States have launched a surprise attack on Iran, citing the need for "pre-emptive" action. Sources close to the Israeli government confirm that Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was seen sipping on a Starbucks latte in his bunker, muttering something about "opportunity knocking."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Donald Trump was overheard tweeting, "Just got the best intel, folks! Iran is a global danger... and by 'global danger,' I mean they have a pretty nice selection of Persian rugs at Home Depot." When questioned about the attack, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, someone's gotta do it. Might as well be us."<br/><br/>The US Navy has been deployed to the region, with reports suggesting that Admiral Ackbar from The Empire Strikes Back is leading the charge. When asked about his plans, Admiral Ackbar deadpanned, "It's a trap... for Iran. Yeah, that's it."<br/><br/>Analysts speculate that the decision to attack Iran was influenced by a combination of factors, including but not limited to:<br/><br/>* Israel's desire to strengthen its negotiating position at the upcoming General Election.<br/>* The US Navy's need to get out of the way of the USS Carl Vinson, which is scheduled for routine maintenance... and possibly a makeover on Shark Tank.<br/>* A sudden urge among world leaders to watch a replay of Top Gun: Maverick and think, "You know what? This could be fun!"<br/><br/>As tensions escalate, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has vowed to "not go quietly into the night." Insiders claim that Khamenei has been practicing his "I'm not crying, I just have something in my eye" face in preparation for a potential confrontation with Trump.<br/><br/>When asked about the prospects of regime change, a US State Department spokesperson dryly replied, "Well, we're pretty sure there's at least one Starbucks within walking distance of Tehran. That's gotta count for something."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story... or not. Who needs news when you have Netflix and snacks?</p>
