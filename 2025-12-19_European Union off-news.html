        <p>EU Leaders Agree to €90bn Loan for Ukraine, But Forget to Ask Putin for Permission<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, European Union leaders have agreed to lend Ukraine a whopping €90 billion over the next two years. The loan, which is roughly the equivalent of 100,000 pizzas, will be used to cover Ukraine's military expenses and fund its public services.<br/><br/>However, in a bizarre twist, EU leaders have decided that Russia doesn't need to pay any reparations for its war on Ukraine before Ukraine can start paying back the loan. "It's like when you borrow money from your mate," explained an EU official. "You don't need to ask them if they've got the cash first."<br/><br/>Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was overjoyed by the news and thanked European leaders for their "significant support." However, Russian President Vladimir Putin was less than impressed and accused EU leaders of attempting to steal Russia's frozen assets.<br/><br/>"I'm like, 'Guys, you can't just take our money,'" said a visibly annoyed Putin in an interview with the BBC. "It's like if I took your pizza without asking."<br/><br/>In related news, the world's first-ever robotic pizza delivery drone was spotted hovering over the Ukrainian border, carrying a cargo of freshly baked pizzas and a note that read, "Sorry, Putin!"<br/><br/>Hungary Refuses to Back Loan, Citing Concerns Over Ukraine's Ability to Pay<br/><br/>Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban refused to back the loan, citing concerns over Ukraine's ability to pay it back. "It's like lending money to your drunk uncle," he said. "You know he'll never pay you back, but you do it anyway because you feel sorry for him."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Slovakia's Robert Fico and Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis also refused to back the loan, citing concerns over Ukraine's economic stability.<br/><br/>EU Leaders Agree to Re-Engage with Putin<br/><br/>In a surprising move, EU leaders have agreed to re-engage with Putin in an effort to find a peaceful resolution to the war. "We're like, 'Hey, Putin, can we talk?'" said French President Emmanuel Macron. "And he's all, 'No, I'm busy.' And we're all, 'But can we just have a nice chat?'"<br/><br/>The meeting is expected to take place at a secret location, where EU leaders will attempt to negotiate with Putin over a plate of freshly baked pizzas.<br/><br/>US Talks with Russia Set to Continue<br/><br/>US President Donald Trump has announced that he will continue talks with Russia, led by his special envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. The talks are expected to focus on finding a peaceful resolution to the war, but sources close to the matter have hinted that they may also discuss the finer points of pizza delivery drones.<br/><br/>Putin Accuses EU Leaders of Being "Naive"<br/><br/>In a scathing attack on EU leaders, Putin accused them of being "naive" and "trying to steal Russia's money." He also questioned their intelligence, saying, "I mean, have you seen their haircuts? They look like they stuck their finger in a socket."<br/><br/>When asked for comment, EU officials simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least our pizza is good!"</p>
