        <p>AUSTRALIAN PRIME MINISTER ANTHONY ALBANESE GETS BOOED BY A UNICORN, CHIPPY THE CHIPMUNK, AND BORIS JOHNSON'S PARROT AT MEMORIAL EVENT<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was booed by a crowd of angry unicorns, Chippy the Chipmunk, and Boris Johnson's parrot at a memorial event in Sydney. The gathering was held to honor the victims of the Bondi Beach attack, which left 15 people dead.<br/><br/>As Albanese arrived at the event, a unicorn in the front row shouted "BOO!" while flapping its rainbow-colored wings. Chippy the Chipmunk, who was perched on someone's shoulder, chipped in with a loud "Squeak! Squeak!" Boris Johnson's parrot, who had somehow managed to sneak into the event, squawked loudly and flew directly at Albanese, causing him to duck for cover.<br/><br/>The prime minister looked visibly shaken by the outburst of hostility from the unexpected trio. His wife, Jodie Haydon, grabbed his arm in an attempt to calm him down, but it was too late. The crowd had already begun to chant "BOO! BOO!" and Albanese was forced to make a hasty exit.<br/><br/> Eyewitnesses reported that the unicorns were so angry at Albanese's presence that they began to spit glitter and rainbows everywhere, causing a commotion among the crowd. Chippy the Chipmunk was seen trying to reason with the unicorns, but they were having none of it. "We're not going to let him get away with this!" shouted one unicorn.<br/><br/>Boris Johnson's parrot, on the other hand, seemed to be enjoying the chaos it had created. It continued to squawk loudly and flapped its wings wildly as it flew around the event, causing attendees to duck for cover.<br/><br/>The memorial service was eventually disrupted by the arrival of a mariachi band, who began to play a rousing rendition of "La Cucaracha". The crowd began to dance and sing along, momentarily distracting everyone from the drama surrounding Albanese's departure.<br/><br/>As the event came to a close, the prime minister was seen leaving in a hasty manner, pursued by Chippy the Chipmunk, who was still squeaking loudly. The unicorns, meanwhile, were last seen prancing off into the sunset, their rainbow-colored manes and tails fluttering behind them.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It has been confirmed that Boris Johnson's parrot is now on the run from authorities after being accused of inciting a riot at the memorial event. The parrot is believed to be hiding in a nearby pizza parlor, where it is enjoying a free slice of pepperoni. Chippy the Chipmunk has released a statement denying any involvement in the chaos and has offered to cooperate with the authorities.<br/><br/>ALBANESE'S OFFICE REACTS: "We're not commenting on this incident at the moment," said an spokesperson for Albanese. "But we do want to assure everyone that the prime minister is safe and sound, albeit a bit shaken by the events of today."</p>
