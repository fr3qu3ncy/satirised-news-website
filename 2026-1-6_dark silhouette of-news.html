        <p>BREAKING: Drone Strike Hits El-Obeid City, Kills 13 People, Including 8 Kids, Medics Say<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a drone strike has killed at least 13 people, including 8 kids, in the city of el-Obeid, Sudan. But here's the thing - it wasn't just any ordinary drone attack. No, no, no. This was a drone strike masterminded by none other than Darth Vader himself.<br/><br/>Sources close to the RSF (Rapid Support Forces) say that Vader, who's been hiding in plain sight as a senior official in the Sudanese government, decided to take matters into his own hands and launch a surprise attack on the city. And by "surprise attack," I mean he just randomly flew over the city in his custom-made TIE Advanced fighter drone and started blowing things up.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Vader's drone was seen flying overhead, playing a loop of "Who Let the Dogs Out" by Baha Men before dropping a payload of 13 angry bees on the unsuspecting populace. When asked about the incident, an RSF spokesperson said, "Uh, yeah... about that... Well, you see, it was just a little misunderstanding between Vader and some pesky kids who wouldn't stop calling him 'Daddy.' Next thing we knew, there were 13 people dead and 8 kids crying for their mothers."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Sudanese military has issued a statement saying they're "shocked" by the incident, but only because they had just finished making a fresh pot of coffee in the break room. "We had no idea Vader was planning to launch a drone attack," said a spokesperson. "But now that we think about it, he's been acting really suspiciously lately - always wearing his cape indoors and using the Force to make the office copier jam."<br/><br/>As for the victims' families, they're still trying to come to terms with the tragedy. When asked what message they wanted to send to Vader, one grieving mother said, "Tell him that if he wants to play at being a supervillain, he should at least have the decency to wear his cape in public and not just fly around killing people willy-nilly."<br/><br/>In related news, the city of el-Obeid has been put on high alert, with residents advised to stay indoors and avoid any areas where Vader might be flying overhead. And if you see a black-clad figure in the sky yelling "I am your father!" while firing laser beams from his eyes, just ignore him and go about your day as usual.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The RSF has since issued a statement saying that they're reviewing their policies on intergalactic cooperation with Sith Lords. In related news, Darth Vader's TIE Advanced fighter drone has been spotted flying over the city of Khartoum, playing a loop of "Who Let the Dogs Out" and leaving a trail of angry bees in its wake.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>And here are some more updates:<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: The city of el-Obeid has been placed under curfew until further notice. During this time, all residents are advised to stay indoors, avoid any areas where Vader might be flying overhead, and refrain from making any comments about the incident on social media.<br/><br/>UPDATE 3: The RSF has announced that they're implementing new security measures to prevent future drone attacks by Sith Lords. These measures include installing more force fields around government buildings, hiring a team of expert Jedi to patrol the skies, and requiring all officials to wear their capes in public at all times.<br/><br/>UPDATE 4: Vader's TIE Advanced fighter drone has been spotted flying over the city of Darfur, playing a loop of "Who Let the Dogs Out" and leaving a trail of angry bees in its wake. Residents are advised to stay indoors until further notice.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
