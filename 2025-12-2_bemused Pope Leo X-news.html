        <p>POPE DEMANDS JUSTICE FOR BEIRUT BLAST VICTIMS, BUT FIRST ASKS IF ANYONE HAS SEEN HIS KEYS<br/><br/>In a surprise move, Pope Leo XIV stormed the Beirut port blast site yesterday, demanding justice for the more than 200 victims of the disaster. However, in a bizarre twist, he first asked if anyone had seen his keys. "I'm all about seeking justice and truth," said the Pontiff, before realizing he couldn't get into the car without them.<br/><br/>"I mean, seriously, have you seen my black Mercedes? It's a real beauty, and I don't want to be late for the Christmas party back at the Vatican," said the Pope, frantically searching through his pockets. "I swear, I could've sworn I left it right here..."<br/><br/>As he searched, the Pope led a silent prayer with some of the relatives of the victims, who were understandably distracted by the commotion. One of them, Cecile Roukoz, was heard muttering under her breath, "Dude, focus! There are people dying over here!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, other family members took to social media to express their frustration at the Pope's priorities. Tatiana Hasrouty tweeted, "Hey @PopeLeoXIV, nice try with the prayer and all, but can you please just find your keys already? We've got a country to run into the ground."<br/><br/>POPE SINGS 'WE ARE THE CHAMPIONS' ON BEIRUT WATERFRONT<br/><br/>Later that day, Pope Leo celebrated the final Mass of his trip on Beirut's waterfront, where he treated the crowd of 150,000 people to an impromptu rendition of "We Are the Champions." The crowd was initially confused, but soon joined in with their own version of the song, complete with made-up lyrics.<br/><br/>As the Pope sang, a group of locals took advantage of the distraction to sneak into the nearby McDonald's and order a bunch of Big Macs. Witnesses report that one of them even asked for no pickles, saying "I'm trying to be spiritual, man."<br/><br/>POPE DEMANDS LEBANON UNITE, BUT FIRST ASKS IF ANYONE WANTS TO BUY A CIGAR<br/><br/>In his address to the crowd, Pope Leo appealed for unity among Lebanon's diverse communities. However, just as he was getting into stride, a group of smokers interrupted him with a loud "Hey, does anyone want to buy a cigar?"<br/><br/>The Pope paused, seemingly taken aback by the sudden interruption. After a brief moment, he replied, "Sorry guys, I'm on a tight schedule. But if you want to make a deal, I'll give you 10 euros for that pack of Marlboros."<br/><br/>POPE RETURNS TO ROME WITH KEYS IN HAND<br/><br/>As the Pope wrapped up his three-day visit and headed back to Rome, he was seen carrying his black Mercedes keys proudly in hand. When asked what had taken him so long to find them, he simply shrugged and said, "Hey, when you've been a priest for as long as I have, you learn to prioritize."<br/><br/>In related news, the Vatican has announced that Pope Leo's upcoming Christmas party will feature a special guest appearance by Elvis Presley. When asked why, the Pontiff simply smiled and said, "Because who doesn't love a good Christmas celebration with some killer karaoke?"</p>
