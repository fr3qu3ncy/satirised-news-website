        <p>BREAKING: TRUMP TAKES OVER VENEZUELA WITH ELON MUSK AS CO-PILOT AND A TEAM OF PROFESSIONAL WRESTLERS AS BODYGUARDS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump has declared himself the supreme ruler of Venezuela after capturing Nicolás Maduro, the country's leader, and forcing him to watch an endless loop of Mariah Carey music videos.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Trump was inspired by his love of "The Apprentice" reality TV show when he decided to take over Venezuela. "I mean, who wouldn't want to run a country like a business?" Trump exclaimed in a statement. "And with my exceptional leadership skills and Elon Musk's expertise in artificial intelligence, we're going to make Venezuela great again... or at least as great as the Trump Tower toilet paper."<br/><br/>Maduro, who was allegedly involved in a plot to flood the US with drugs and gang members (though no evidence of this was found), was flown out of Venezuela on Air Force One, where he was greeted by a team of professional wrestlers, including Hulk Hogan and John Cena. The two wrestling legends were dressed in full regalia, complete with bandanas and sleeveless vests, and were seen bodyslamming Maduro into a nearby trash can.<br/><br/>"I'm not saying I'm the toughest guy in the world," Trump boasted, "but I've made some really great deals with my buddies Hulkster and Cenation. They're going to help me take care of this whole Venezuela thing... or at least until we get tired of it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Elon Musk has been appointed co-pilot of Venezuela's government, where he will oversee the implementation of his plans for a hyperloop-powered oil industry. "It's going to be huge," Musk promised. "Just huge. We're talking SpaceX-huge. And with my team of AI-powered accountants, we'll make sure that Venezuela's economy is so strong, it'll be like... well, have you ever seen the numbers for the Trump Organization? It's amazing!"<br/><br/>In response to criticism from international leaders and human rights groups, Trump dismissed concerns about his actions in Venezuela. "Let me tell you, folks," he said. "I've done this before. I mean, remember when I took over Mexico? Oh wait, no one does. That never happened."<br/><br/>As tensions escalate between the US and Venezuela, the international community is bracing for the worst. The United Nations has issued a statement calling for calm, but Trump just laughed it off, saying, "Those guys are so out of touch. Have you seen their cafeteria food? It's like they're trying to poison the world!"<br/><br/>And so, with his trusty sidekicks Hulkster and Cenation by his side, President Trump has taken over Venezuela in a move that's being hailed as... well, let's just say it's going to be "yuge."</p>
