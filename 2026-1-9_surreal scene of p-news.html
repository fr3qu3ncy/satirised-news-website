        <p>Rallies on major roads in the capital and in Iran's second city were peaceful and not dispersed by security forces... or so they thought<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, protests broke out in Iran's capital city Tehran, where a large crowd of protesters, led by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, marched through the streets chanting "Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?" and "We're here for the free donuts!" The demonstrations were peaceful and not dispersed by security forces... until someone brought out the chicken nuggets.<br/><br/>As the crowd grew larger, it was joined by a surprise appearance of Justin Bieber, who proceeded to sing his hit song "Sorry" while riding a unicycle. The protesters were not sorry, however, as they continued to chant and wave their signs in the air.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Iran's second city Mashhad, a similar scene played out, with protesters marching through the streets while being led by a group of rowdy Accountants from PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC). Yes, you read that right. PwC accountants. They were chanting "We want our tax returns!" and waving their calculators in the air.<br/><br/>The protests were sparked by anger over the collapse of the Iranian currency, which had led to a shortage of Doritos at local markets. Protesters were seen holding signs that read "Doritos for all!" and "Where's my free nacho?"<br/><br/>As the day went on, things only got more bizarre. In one video, a group of protesters were seen attempting to storm a government building while being chased by a pack of wild hyenas. It was unclear what the hyenas had to do with anything, but they seemed to be enjoying themselves.<br/><br/>Later in the evening, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the late former shah, appeared on social media and called on Iranians to "take to the streets and, as a united front, shout your demands." He was quickly joined by his mom, who said "Can someone please pass the sugar?"<br/><br/>The Iranian government responded to the protests by shutting down the internet nationwide... or so they thought. Meanwhile, online, people were sharing videos of protesters chanting "Don't be afraid, we are all together" while being led by a conga line of flamingos.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that the protests were not just limited to Iran. In nearby Dubai, a group of camels were seen leading a protest march while carrying signs that read "Free water and snacks for all!" and "We're here for the falafel!"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: things are about to get really weird in Iran.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just got word that Elmo has been spotted in Tehran, leading a group of protesters in a chant of "Elmo loves you!" and waving his favorite rubber chicken. This is getting weirder by the minute...</p>
