        <p>BREAKING: US Emissions of Planet-Warming Gases Rise for the First Time in Three Years... Because Who Needs a Clean Environment When You Can Have More Coal and Data Centers?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has seen its emissions of planet-warming gases rise for the first time in three years. And it's not like we didn't see this coming - after all, who needs a sustainable future when you can have more coal and data centers?<br/><br/>According to a new analysis by the Rhodium Group (which sounds suspiciously like a made-up name, but hey, maybe they're just trying to sound cool), last year saw a 2.4% increase in greenhouse gas emissions in the US. And it's all because of that pesky cold weather we had at the beginning of 2025 - you know, the one where people were all like "Brrr, I need some hot chocolate" and then proceeded to burn even more fossil fuels?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The growth in data centers and cryptocurrency mining operations (because who doesn't love a good Bitcoin or two?) was also a major contributor to the rise in emissions. I mean, what's a few thousand terawatts of electricity between friends? It's not like it's going to cause any harm... oh wait, it totally is.<br/><br/>And let's not forget about coal - that dirty, dirty word. Last year saw a 13% surge in US coal use, because apparently someone out there still thinks it's a good idea to burn coal for electricity. I mean, who needs renewable energy when you can have coal?<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But what about solar power?" Well, let me tell you, solar power did experience a major growth spurt in the US last year, rising by 34%. But hey, that's just a drop in the bucket compared to all the coal and data centers we've got going on.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on President Trump - I mean, who needs a climate-friendly policy when you can have a president who loves fossil fuels? According to some observers (okay, it was one guy from Climate Power), Trump's policies didn't "meaningfully impact" the rise in emissions. But hey, at least he's consistent?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks - the US is back on track to destroying the planet, and we're all just along for the ride. Silver linings: our roads are getting more electric vehicles (yay, future!), and we've got more data centers than ever before (because who needs personal space when you can have a massive data center in your backyard?).<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THE SLOW-MOTION TRAINWRECK THAT IS US ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY!<br/><br/>[IMAGE OF A GIANT DATA CENTER IN TEXAS WITH THE TAGLINE "COMPUTER POWER, NOT CLIMATE CHANGE"]<br/><br/>Stay woke, and try to ignore the impending doom...</p>
