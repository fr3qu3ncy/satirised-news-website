        <p>US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's serious talks about Middle East peace were hilariously derailed by a series of absurd events, including the sudden appearance of Mr. Bean, a giant rubber chicken, and an inflatable unicorn playing "Who Let The Dogs Out?" on a kazoo.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>TRUMP AND NETANYAHU GET TOGETHER FOR SOME SERIOUS TALKS IN FLORIDA... WITH A SPECIAL APPEARANCE BY MR. BEAN<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu met in Florida for some serious talks about the Middle East. But things took a turn when Mr. Bean suddenly appeared out of nowhere, wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and carrying a giant rubber chicken.<br/><br/>As they sat down to discuss the finer points of ceasefire agreements and Palestinian statehood, Mr. Bean suddenly piped up with "Oh, sorry chaps! I forgot my lunch in the car... do you have any crisps?"<br/><br/>Trump, taken aback by the sudden interruption, replied "Uh, no, we're in the middle of a very important discussion about peace in the Middle East. Can it wait?"<br/><br/>Netanyahu, equally perplexed, chimed in with "Yes, yes, please do tell us more about your crispy snacks... maybe they can help broker a ceasefire between Israel and Hamas?"<br/><br/>As the three continued to chat, things only got weirder when a giant inflatable unicorn suddenly appeared outside the meeting room, playing a tinny rendition of "Who Let The Dogs Out?" on a kazoo.<br/><br/>BREAKING: GAZA CEASEFIRE PROGRESS REPORTED... BUT ONLY IF YOU COUNT THE NUMBER OF CRACKERS EATEN BY NETANYAHU<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Gaza, reports were emerging that the ceasefire agreement was progressing smoothly. But only if you count the number of crackers eaten by Netanyahu during his talks with Trump.<br/><br/>"It's a miracle!" exclaimed Hamas officials. "Netanyahu has eaten an entire packet of salt and vinegar crisps... surely this is a sign that peace is on the horizon?"<br/><br/>IRANIAN LEADER SAYS COUNTRY IS IN 'ALL-OUT WAR' WITH ISRAEL, US AND EUROPE... BUT FIRST THEY HAVE TO FINISH THIS CAKE<br/><br/>In related news, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian announced that his country was in "all-out war" with Israel, the US and Europe. But only after they finished baking a cake for the neighborhood block party.<br/><br/>"We're not just fighting for our rights," declared Pezeshkian. "We're also fighting for the perfect soufflé... no one wants to be known as the nation that brought down the greatest empire in history with a soggy bottom."<br/><br/>As the world teetered on the brink of chaos, Mr. Bean suddenly reappeared, this time wearing a pair of novelty Groucho Marx glasses and carrying a tray of freshly baked croissants.<br/><br/>"Time for a snack break, lads!" he exclaimed. "Who's up for some flaky pastry?"<br/><br/>And so, in the midst of all this chaos, Trump and Netanyahu continued to chat with Mr. Bean, while Pezeshkian fought on with his cake... and the world just kept spinning around in circles, wondering what on earth was going on.</p>
