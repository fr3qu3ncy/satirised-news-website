        <p>Meta Confirms It Removed Mange Kimambi's Social Media Accounts, But Not Before She Turned Them into a Time Capsule for Her Cat<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Meta has confirmed that it removed social media accounts belonging to Tanzanian activist Mange Kimambi, but not before she turned them into a time capsule for her cat, Mr. Whiskers. Yes, you read that right - Mr. Whiskers.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter, Kimambi had been using her Instagram account to mobilize protests against the Tanzanian government, and Meta took notice. "We don't allow people to create new accounts that are similar to those we've previously removed for violating our Community Standards," said a spokesperson for Meta, trying to sound as serious as possible while giggling uncontrollably.<br/><br/>But little did they know, Kimambi had been secretly building a time capsule within her Instagram account. It was filled with cat videos, memes about the Tanzanian government's lack of accountability, and Mr. Whiskers' favorite snack - tuna-flavored cat treats.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Kimambi simply said, "I'm not sure what you're talking about. I mean, who doesn't have a time capsule in their Instagram account? It's a thing now."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Tanzanian government is still trying to figure out how to silence Kimambi and her cat, Mr. Whiskers. They've tried blocking her X account, but she just switched to using it as a digital journal for Mr. Whiskers' veterinary appointments.<br/><br/>The US Department of State has weighed in on the situation, stating that they are "reviewing their relationship with Tanzania" - code for "we're not sure what's going on, but we don't like it."<br/><br/>And so, the world waits with bated breath as Kimambi and Mr. Whiskers continue to evade the authorities and enjoy their social media freedom.<br/><br/>Update: The Tanzanian government has announced plans to introduce a new law that makes it illegal for anyone to use social media for anything other than cat videos and memes about the government's lack of accountability.</p>
