        <p>BOB WEIR, GRATEFUL DEAD CO-FOUNDER, DIES AGED 78: A LIFE OF PSYCHEDELIC ROCK AND REALLY BAD HUMOR<br/><br/> Ah, the psychedelic rock legend has finally gone, leaving behind a legacy of tie-dye shirts and really bad puns. Bob Weir, co-founder of the Grateful Dead, passed away aged 78 after a long battle with cancer and lung issues that seemed to be fueled by his love for cigars.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the band (okay, it was just Jerry Garcia's ghost), Weir died surrounded by loved ones, including his wife Natascha, who was busy making him a "Get Well Soon" card while simultaneously being an expert at Google search. His children, Shala and Chloe, were also there, but they were too busy Instagramming their cats to notice.<br/><br/>In a statement that read like it was written by a 5-year-old on valium, Weir's management team said: "There is no final curtain here, not really. Only the sense of someone setting off again...like when you leave your keys in the car, but this time with a more psychedelic vibe." Yeah, because that makes perfect sense.<br/><br/>Weir's career spanned over 60 years, which is like, forever. He joined the Grateful Dead in 1965, and within a few years, they became so popular that people started to notice them – much to the dismay of their neighbors, who were just trying to live their best lives without constant jamming in the background.<br/><br/>The band's style was like a fusion of psychedelia, folk, Americana, and "Oh boy, I'm really high right now." It was so influential that it paved the way for other bands to become equally terrible. In 1994, they were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame, which is like being awarded a lifetime supply of vinyl records – a true honor.<br/><br/>Throughout his career, Weir was involved in various spin-offs, including Dead & Company, which was essentially just him rebranding as "Dead Again" with some new guy on guitar. They even had a residency at the Las Vegas Sphere, where they performed for people who were too old to remember the words to "Truckin'".<br/><br/>Weir's death has sparked an outpouring of tributes from fellow musicians, including Slash, who posted a photo of Weir playing his guitar while wearing a pair of shades and a mullet. Don Felder, former guitarist of the Eagles, wrote: "I first saw Bob at Woodstock with the Grateful Dead...and was blown away by that whole band, and the musicianship...of my tour bus driver."<br/><br/>As for Weir's final performance, it seems he was in the middle of a particularly epic jam session when he suddenly stood up, threw his guitar over his shoulder like a caveman, and shouted: "That's it, folks! Time to retire!" And then he went to bed.<br/><br/>Rest in peace, Bob. May your legacy be forever remembered as the guy who made you want to wear tie-dye shirts and listen to music that sounded like someone was running their fingers over a keyboard while on a pogo stick.</p>
