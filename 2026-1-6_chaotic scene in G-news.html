        <p>BREAKING: Greenland in Chaos as Donald Trump Threatens to Take Over, NATO on the Brink of Collapse, and Elmo Makes an Appearance<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has announced his plans to annex Greenland, leaving the international community in a state of panic. But it's not just the Danes who are worried - sources close to NATO have revealed that the alliance is on the brink of collapse as member countries struggle to come up with a unified response.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Elmo from Sesame Street has been spotted in the midst of the chaos, attempting to broker a peace deal between Trump and Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen. When asked about his involvement, Elmo simply said, "I'm here to help, guys! We can all get along!"<br/><br/>As tensions escalate, NATO officials have resorted to calling an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis. However, things took a turn for the worse when they realized that their conference room was not equipped with sufficient snacks - including enough Danish pastries.<br/><br/>"We're talking about the fate of Greenland here!" exclaimed one official, "And we can't even get our hands on some decent pastry?"<br/><br/>The situation has also drawn in other unexpected players. Vladimir Putin, the Russian President, has been overheard whispering to Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff, "You know, Donald, I think we could work out a deal for Greenland... for a small price, of course."<br/><br/>And just when you thought things couldn't get any crazier, Kim Kardashian West walked into the room and started taking selfies with Elmo. When asked what she was doing there, Kim replied, "I'm here to show my support for Denmark's Prime Minister - I mean, who wouldn't want to take a selfie with this adorable guy?"<br/><br/>As the world teeters on the edge of chaos, one thing is clear: Greenland has become a pawn in a much larger game. Will Trump succeed in his plans to annex the island? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The European Union has just announced that they will be holding an emergency meeting to discuss the crisis - and have promised to provide "all necessary pastries" for the occasion.<br/><br/>AND IN OTHER NEWS: Elmo has been spotted selling Danish pastries outside the conference room, with a sign that reads, "Elmo's Danish Delights: 5 bucks a pastry!
