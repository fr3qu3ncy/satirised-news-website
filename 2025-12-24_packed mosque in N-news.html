        <p>BREAKING: Explosion Hits Packed Mosque in Nigeria, Chaos Ensues<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, an explosion rocked a packed mosque in Nigeria's Maiduguri city on Wednesday evening. Eyewitnesses claim the blast occurred during evening prayers, but what's even more astonishing is that it happened just as the congregation was about to sing their favorite pop song, "I Gotta Feeling" by The Black Eyed Peas.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad movie," said local resident and eyewitness, Bob Marley (not the one from Jamaica, but rather a Nigerian dude who loves reggae music). "One minute we were all singing along to 'Boom Boom Pow,' the next thing I knew, there were explosions everywhere. It was like Beyoncé's performance at Coachella, but with more smoke."<br/><br/>Reports suggest that seven people were killed and several others injured in the blast, but officials are still trying to determine who or what was responsible for the explosion.<br/><br/>"We're not sure if it was a terrorist attack or just a really bad case of gas buildup," said a spokesperson from the Nigerian government. "But rest assured, we'll get to the bottom of this and make sure that whoever did it faces the consequences...or at least gets a good time-out."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, residents are still trying to process what happened.<br/><br/>"I was just praying for world peace when suddenly, K-pop music started blasting through the speakers," said another eyewitness. "I mean, I love BTS as much as the next person, but not during prayer time, dude!"<br/><br/>As authorities investigate the cause of the explosion, many are left wondering if it's all just a huge misunderstanding.<br/><br/>"I heard it was actually a group of teenagers trying to get their Instagram-worthy ' explosion shot' for their social media posts," said a local teenager. "They must have accidentally pressed the wrong button on their selfie stick...or maybe it was just a really powerful vape."<br/><br/>The incident has left many Nigerians questioning the stability of their country's internet connection and wondering if this is all just a elaborate prank.<br/><br/>"Is this some kind of joke?" asked an exasperated resident. "First, our power goes out every other day, now our mosques are exploding...what's next?!"<br/><br/>In related news, Nigerian officials have announced plans to increase security measures around mosques nationwide, including installing additional Bluetooth speakers and Wi-Fi hotspots.<br/><br/>"We want to ensure that our citizens can worship in peace, without any distractions from the outside world," said a spokesperson. "So, we'll be setting up more charging stations for people's phones...just in case they need to Facetime their relatives during prayer time."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
