        <p>BREAKING: Don Lemon and 30 Other Protesters Get a Taste of Their Own Medicine<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former CNN anchor Don Lemon and 30 other protesters have been charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship. Yes, you read that right – these agitators thought it was a good idea to crash a church service in Minnesota while chanting "ICE out" and "Justice for Renee Good." We're not sure what's more ridiculous, their protest or the fact that they got caught on camera wearing "I'm with stupid" t-shirts.<br/><br/>According to sources (okay, it's just us), Don Lemon was live-streaming the chaos when it went down, and he claimed he was just doing his job as an independent journalist. However, the indictment says he and his crew entered the church in a coordinated takeover-style attack, which is just a fancy way of saying they caused a scene. Who knew being a journalist meant you could crash a church service?<br/><br/>The prosecutor, Pam Bondi (yes, that Pam Bondi), seemed particularly excited about this case, writing on social media, "YOU CANNOT ATTACK A HOUSE OF WORSHIP. If you do so, you cannot hide from us — we will find you, arrest you, and prosecute you." We're not sure what's more impressive, her use of all caps or the fact that she used a bunch of lawyer-y words to sound smart.<br/><br/>The protesters were charged with conspiracy against religious freedom at a place of worship (which is just a fancy way of saying they got in trouble for being obnoxious), injuring, intimidating, and interfering with the exercise of the right of religious freedom at a place of worship. Wow, that's quite a mouthful!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Doug Wardlow, the lawyer representing Cities Church, celebrated the news by saying it "sends a clear message: houses of worship are off limits for those who would use chaos and intimidation to advance a political agenda." We're not sure what's more impressive, his ability to say that in one breath or the fact that he managed to fit so many big words into one sentence.<br/><br/>In related news, Don Lemon has pleaded not guilty, which is just code for "I'm going to appeal this and make it all about me." Stay tuned, folks – this one's going to be a wild ride!<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've been informed that the protesters are now wearing "I'm with stupid" t-shirts featuring a picture of Don Lemon. That's just classy.<br/><br/>SIDEBAR: Did you know that Iran launched a missile attack on Israel and Qatar? Yeah, we didn't think so. In other news, have you seen the latest sales figures for Justin Bieber's latest album? Okay, moving on...</p>
