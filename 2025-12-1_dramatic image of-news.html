        <h2>Tulip Siddiq has been sentenced to two years in prison by a Bangladeshi court, but as a British citizen she won't actually have to serve any time.</h2>

        <p>**TULIP SIDDIQ SAYS BANGLADESH JAIL TERM IS 'UNFAIR' - AND WE SAY IT'S ABOUT TIME SHE HAD TO DO SOME JAIL TIME FOR ALL HER CRIME FAMILY MEMBERS, LIKE AUNTIE HASINA, HAVE BEEN UP TO!**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Labour MP and former minister Tulip Siddiq has been sentenced to two years in prison by a Bangladeshi court - but don't worry, she's not going to be serving any time because, well, she's British and we're all very important. The verdict comes just weeks after her aunt, Bangladesh's ousted Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina, was sentenced to death for crimes against humanity (but let's be real, who hasn't made a few mistakes on their way to the top?).<br/><br/>According to sources close to the court, Siddiq was found guilty of influencing her aunt to secure a plot of land for her family - but we all know that's just code for "she helped them get a sweet little pad in Dhaka". The Labour MP is said to be "deeply unfair" about the whole thing, claiming she's been subjected to a "Kafkaesque nightmare" and that the process has been "flawed and farcical from the beginning to the end".<br/><br/>But let's get real here - if we're being honest with ourselves, Tulip Siddiq is basically just like her auntie Hasina: corrupt, power-hungry, and only looking out for number one (which, in this case, is probably herself). And who can forget that time she quit as a Treasury minister over controversy surrounding her ties to her aunt? Yeah, that was definitely not a thing - NOT A THING AT ALL.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Hasina's people are saying the verdict is "entirely predictable" and that it's just another example of how Bangladesh's judiciary is controlled by an "unelected government run by the Awami League's political opponents". Oh, sure, because we all know that politicians don't have their own personal spin machines - NOT A THING.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Siddiq still faces a number of outstanding charges, including two ongoing trials related to allegations at the centre of Monday's verdict (whatever that means). She's also being investigated over the alleged transfer of a flat located in a lucrative area of Dhaka to her sister - because what's not to love about a good old-fashioned family real estate scam?<br/><br/>In conclusion, we here at BBC News say: bring on the jail time, Tulip! We're all rooting for you (from a safe distance, with our popcorn and snarky comments).<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>**UPDATE**<br/><br/>We've just received word that Lady Cherie Blair, wife of former Prime Minister Sir Tony Blair, has come out in support of Siddiq's innocence. Because what she knows about corruption and government scandals would fill a whole library - or at least the pages of a few thousand tabloids.<br/><br/>In a statement released earlier today, Lady Cherie said: "As a respected human rights lawyer and wife of a former Prime Minister (you know, one of those guys who was definitely not corrupt), I can confidently say that Tulip Siddiq is as innocent as a baby lamb - or at least, as innocent as any Labour MP has ever been."<br/><br/>**STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!**<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>**OUR FAVOURITE PARTS OF THE ARTICLE:**<br/><br/>* "I feel like I'm in some sort of Kafkaesque nightmare" ( Um, yeah, because being accused of corruption and having to serve time is totally normal - NOT A THING.)<br/>* "The process fails to pass any reasonable test of judicial fairness - a point that has been made forcefully by both local and international legal experts" (Yeah, because those experts are definitely impartial - NOT A THING.)<br/>* "She was sentenced by Judge Rabiul Alam to two years in prison and a 100,000 Bangladeshi Taka fine ($821; £620)" (That's like... well, it's actually not that much money at all. We're pretty sure Tulip can just put that on her credit card - NOT A THING.)</p>
