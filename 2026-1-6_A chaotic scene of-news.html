        <p>Breaking News: Europe in Chaos as Snow Causes Thousands to Struggle with Boredom<br/><br/>Amsterdam and Paris, the City of Love and Snacks - not quite today. Hundreds of flights have been cancelled due to a freak snowstorm that has left thousands of people stranded at airports, frantically scrolling through their phones for cat videos.<br/><br/>"It's a disaster," said one passenger, Javier Sepulveda, who was trying to fly from Amsterdam to Norway with his accordion-playing chicken, Cluck Norris. "I've been waiting in line since 06:30 local time, and I'm still nowhere near the front. This is unacceptable!"<br/><br/>As the snowflakes continued to fall like a million tiny confetti pieces at Schiphol Airport, passengers were seen queuing up for hours on end, while airline staff frantically tried to clear runways with brooms and dustpans.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Paris, the Eiffel Tower was shut down due to icy conditions, causing thousands of visitors to be stuck in the rain, wondering what they had done to deserve such a fate. "Zut!" exclaimed one tourist, Marie Antoinette, as she clung to her Louis Vuitton bag for dear life.<br/><br/>Back at Amsterdam Airport, passengers were seen attempting to start impromptu air guitar solos with their luggage carts, while others tried to distract themselves by reenacting scenes from The Matrix with the airport's security guards.<br/><br/>In France, five people died in separate incidents due to treacherous driving conditions. Authorities reported that three people died in two separate regions of France after black ice got the best of them. Two more died in separate motor accidents in the Paris region, because who needs road signs when you've got Google Maps, right?<br/><br/>The Balkans were also hit hard by the snow, with a woman dying in Sarajevo after a tree weighed down with wet snow fell on her head. "It was like something out of a horror movie," said one eyewitness, adding that the woman's last words were, "I'm going to get you, tree!"<br/><br/>In related news, Storm Gorettey (pronounced "Go-rette") is expected to hit the UK next week, bringing with it fresh snow and ice warnings. Residents are advised to stock up on snacks and Netflix subscriptions.<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, Schiphol Airport's air traffic control announced that they would be hosting an impromptu rap competition between flight attendants to keep passengers entertained while they waited for their flights to take off again.<br/><br/>"We're going all out to make this experience as fun and memorable as possible," said one flight attendant, MC Snowflake. "Who needs de-icing fluid when you've got rhymes and beats?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, or just go back to bed - whatever you prefer!</p>
