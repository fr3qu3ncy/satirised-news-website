        <p>Lawmakers are threatening to take legal action against the Trump administration for not releasing all the scandalous documents related to Jeffrey Epstein in a timely manner.</p>

        <p>"EPSTEIN FILES SHENANIGANS: Lawmakers Threaten Legal Action Over Unreleased Dirt on the Trump Administration"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Senator Schumer has announced that he's going to introduce a resolution to take legal action against the Trump administration for failing to release all the juicy files related to Jeffrey Epstein. Because, you know, what's more important than getting your hands on some scandalous documents?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (okay, it's just Senator Schumer), the full trove of information was supposed to be released by Friday, but instead, they only managed to spill out a few crumbs of dirt on the Trump administration. And let me tell you, folks, those crumbs are still pretty tasty!<br/><br/>Senator Thomas Massie, who's been at the forefront of this whole debacle (and by "debacle," I mean he's just really good at making excuses for why the government can't get its act together), said that he might try to bring contempt proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi. Because, you know, she's the one responsible for releasing all the secrets about Trump's BFF Epstein.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Representative Ro Khanna has chimed in, saying that they're building a bipartisan coalition to fine Pam Bondi for every day she doesn't release the documents. Oh boy, this is getting juicy!<br/><br/>And if that weren't enough, Senator Tim Kaine (who sounds like a nice guy, but let's be real, he's still part of the problem) said that contempt or impeachment efforts would be "premature." Pre-mature? Come on, Tim! The people want answers, and they want them now!<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Deputy Attorney General Todd Blanche had some choice words for Congress, saying that they're doing everything they're supposed to do (yeah right!) and that bringing contempt proceedings would be a waste of time. I mean, who needs laws when you've got a really good lawyer on your side?<br/><br/>And let's not forget about the image featuring Trump that was reinstated after a backlash! You know what they say: "You can't keep a good scandal down!"<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. The Epstein files saga continues to unfold like a bad soap opera. Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling tale of government incompetence and bureaucratic shenanigans!<br/><br/>Update: In related news, a picture of a chicken wearing a tutu has been released in the Epstein files, and it's all anyone can talk about.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>"Epstein Files: A Timeline of Scandalous Shenanigans"<br/><br/>* January 2023: Senator Schumer announces that he'll introduce a resolution to take legal action against the Trump administration for failing to release all the juicy files related to Jeffrey Epstein.<br/>* February 2023: Representative Thomas Massie threatens contempt proceedings against Attorney General Pam Bondi.<br/>* March 2023: The first batch of documents is released, but they're heavily redacted and contain more information about the chicken in a tutu than anything else.<br/>* April 2023: Senator Tim Kaine says that contempt or impeachment efforts would be "premature."<br/>* May 2023: A picture of Trump with Epstein's favorite cocktail (a.k.a. the "Epstein Express") is leaked, and it's all anyone can talk about.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this thrilling tale!</p>
