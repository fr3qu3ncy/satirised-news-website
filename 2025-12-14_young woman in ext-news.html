        <p>BREAKING: Brown University Shooting Gets a Whole Lot More Interesting<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the recent shooting at Brown University has taken a wild and wacky turn. It turns out that not only were two students killed and nine others injured, but also, the identities of those killed or injured have not yet been released... because they all suddenly became experts in extreme ironing.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, it appears that every single victim had a passion for doing laundry while scaling great heights. Yes, you read that right – extreme ironing. It's like they were trying to set a new Guinness World Record or something.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that as the gunman burst into the classroom, he shouted "You'll never iron your way out of this alive!" before unleashing a hail of gunfire. The victims, all clad in their favorite extreme ironing gear, tried to scramble to safety while simultaneously attempting to get the perfect crease on their socks.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Brown University President Christina Paxson has issued a statement assuring students that they will be provided with an endless supply of laundry detergent and starch to help them cope with the trauma. She also announced that all final exams have been cancelled and replaced with a mandatory extreme ironing course.<br/><br/>In related news, it's been reported that the person of interest detained by police is none other than Elvis Presley himself, who has been living incognito as a Brown University student for the past year. When questioned about his involvement in the shooting, Elvis simply shrugged and said "It's all about the ironing, darlin'."<br/><br/>And if you thought things couldn't get any stranger, just wait – it's been revealed that the suspect was wearing not one, not two, but three camouflage grey masks during the entire ordeal. It turns out he was trying to hide his identity from his arch-nemesis, a rival extreme ironing enthusiast who has been stalking him for years.<br/><br/>As for the US President's comments on the shooting, it seems that Donald Trump has issued a new statement saying "I told you so" – not about the shooting itself, but about the importance of having a good iron. When asked to elaborate, he simply shrugged and said "You can't put a price on a smooth crease, folks."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story... or should I say, stay pressed for more information?</p>
