        <p>BREAKING NEWS: Venezuela's Notorious Prisoner Release Party Just Got a Whole Lot Wilder!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuelan rights activist Javier Tarazona has been released from prison after being held for "defending human rights, denouncing abuses, and speaking out" (basically, he was just being a human rights superhero). But here's the kicker: his release party was attended by none other than Elvis Presley himself, who showed up in a sparkly jumpsuit and started doing backflips off the prison walls.<br/><br/>Tarazona, the head of Fundaredes, was arrested in 2021 for being too good at his job. But it turns out, he's actually just really great at partying, because according to eyewitnesses, his release party was a full-on rave with glow sticks, disco balls, and an impromptu appearance by Shaquille O'Neal, who showed up to play a game of one-on-one basketball with the prison guards.<br/><br/>The government announced that Tarazona's release is part of their efforts to "heal the wounds of political confrontation, violence, and extremism" (which roughly translates to: we're trying to make amends for being super mean to him). But let's be real, it's probably just because they ran out of space in El Helicoide prison and needed someone to take up the extra bed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, US forces are still trying to figure out how to get President Nicolás Maduro back from where he was "borrowed" for a few weeks. According to sources close to the situation, it's not just about getting him back; it's also about finding out who took him in the first place (spoiler alert: it was a bunch of aliens from planet Zorgon).</p>
