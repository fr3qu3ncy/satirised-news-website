        <h2>AUSTRALIA REACHES "Roo" BOTTOM: 33 Indigenous People Die in Custody</h2>

        <p>INDIGENOUS DEATHS IN CUSTODY: AUSTRALIA REACHES NEW LOW<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Australia has reached a new low in the number of Indigenous people who have died in custody. The news is so bad that even Homer Simpson would be like "D'oh!"<br/><br/>According to new figures from the Australian Institute of Criminology, 33 Indigenous people have lost their lives while in custody between last July and this June. That's more than a third of all deaths in custody! It's like someone took all the Native American-themed slot machines at a Las Vegas casino and multiplied them by infinity.<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "But wait, isn't that just a bunch of numbers?" Ah, no! These aren't just numbers, folks. These are human lives. And let me tell you, they're not just any human lives. They're Indigenous lives. You know, the ones with the really cool boomerangs and didgeridoos.<br/><br/>Of course, there's always that one guy who's like "Hey, what about all the non-Indigenous people who die in custody? Don't they count?" And to that I say, "Uh, yeah, sure, they count... but let's not forget the ones with the cool boomerangs first."<br/><br/>Now, back to the numbers. So, 33 Indigenous people died in custody. That's a lot of deaths. More than the number of times Nicolas Cage has been in a bad movie (which is, coincidentally, also 33).<br/><br/>The main cause of death? "Self-inflicted." Yeah, that's right. Because what could possibly go wrong with putting a bunch of Indigenous people in a prison cell and expecting them to just chill out?<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the age thing. The average age of these poor souls was 45 years old! That's like being an adult and still eating cereal for breakfast (no judgment, though).<br/><br/>The Australian state with the highest number of Indigenous deaths in custody? New South Wales. Yeah, because what could possibly go wrong with putting a bunch of people in a prison cell in a state that's already known for its crazy bushfires?<br/><br/>Anyway, it looks like Australia has officially reached rock bottom (or should I say, "roo" bottom?). It's time to get serious about making some changes and getting Indigenous people out of those pesky prison cells. After all, as the great philosopher, Ferris Bueller, once said, "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."<br/><br/>So, there you have it. The latest update on Indigenous deaths in custody from Australia. Stay classy, Aussies!<br/><br/>UPDATES<br/><br/>* A new study has found that the number of Indigenous people who die in custody is directly correlated to the number of times a person says "mate" in a single conversation.<br/>* The Australian government has announced plans to establish a new prison specifically designed for Indigenous people. It'll be called "Indigenousville" and will feature all the amenities you'd expect from a maximum-security prison, including a nice view of the surrounding bushland and a top-notch Aboriginal-language instruction program.<br/><br/>RELATED STORIES<br/><br/>* The Top 10 Reasons Why You Should Never Become a Prison Guard in Australia<br/>* How to Survive a Prison Riot (Indigenous Edition)<br/>* Australia's Indigenous population: A guide to their favorite foods, sports, and cultural practices<br/><br/>(Note: These stories are completely made-up and not based on any real events or facts.
