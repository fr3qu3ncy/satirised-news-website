        <p>UKRAINE STRUGGLING TO KEEP LIGHTS ON UNDER RUSSIAN ATTACK, SAYS ENERGY BOSS... AND CHUCK NORRIS<br/><br/>Oh boy, folks! It's not just a power outage, it's a full-blown crisis in Ukraine. And who better to explain it than DTEK boss Maxim Timchenko and Chuck Norris? That's right, the roundhouse kick master himself has joined forces with Mr. Timchenko to bring you this electrifying news.<br/><br/>UKRAINE'S ENERGY GRID IS GOING... "ROUNDHOUSE KICK"<br/><br/>Maxim Timchenko, CEO of DTEK, told the BBC that the intensity of Russian strikes on Ukraine's energy grid has been so frequent, it's like trying to keep up with Chuck Norris' dance moves. "We just don't have time to recover," he said, while simultaneously punching a bear and riding a unicorn.<br/><br/>"It's like they're saying, 'Hey, Maxim, you know what? We're gonna take out your power grid... and then we're gonna make some nachos!' And I'm like, 'Dude, no way! I've got 5.6 million Ukrainians to keep the lights on for!'" Mr. Timchenko exclaimed.<br/><br/>POWER OUTAGES, BUT NOT THE KIND YOU'RE THINKING OF<br/><br/>Tens of thousands of people in Odesa have been without electricity for three days straight – not that it's stopped the party, though. Yana, a local resident, said, "Life has been difficult, but people are very supportive of each other... and by 'supportive,' I mean they've invited me to charge my phone at their house, because who needs personal space, anyway?"<br/><br/>Across Ukraine, electricity is being rationed – think of it as the ultimate game of "Simon Says"... except Simon's a Russian general, and he's saying, "Turn off your lights... NOW!"<br/><br/>CHUCK NORRIS WEIGHS IN<br/><br/>When asked for his take on the situation, Chuck Norris said, "I've got one thing to say: 'You mess with Ukraine's energy grid? You're messing with Chuck Norris!' I'd roundhouse kick those Russian drones all the way back to Moscow... or at least until they get tired of being pummeled by a 75-year-old Texas legend."<br/><br/>SO, WHAT'S NEXT FOR UKRAINE?<br/><br/>As President Volodymyr Zelensky said, "Every night Ukrainian parents hold their children in basements and shelters hoping our air defence will hold... or at least until Chuck Norris shows up to kick some butt." DTEK's Mr. Timchenko added, "We will not give up! We have a responsibility to millions of mothers to have power and heat... and also to provide decent Wi-Fi for all the gamers out there."<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks, for more updates on this electrifying saga!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Related stories:<br/><br/>* CHUCK NORRIS TAKES ON RUSSIA'S ENERGY GRID: The roundhouse kick master has pledged his support to Ukraine's energy needs... and also promised to teach Russian generals some Texas-style dance moves.<br/>* RUSSIAN STRIKES HAVE UKRAINE SCRAMBLING FOR SPARE PARTS: DTEK is searching high and low for replacement parts, but Chuck Norris has offered to help scour the globe for any spare roundhouse kicks they might need.<br/>* UKRAINE'S ENERGY BOSS GETS A NEW TITLE: "CHUCK NORRIS' ENERGY PARTNER": Maxim Timchenko has been promoted to this new role, thanks to his impressive beard-growing skills and ability to take a selfie with Chuck Norris while riding a unicorn.</p>
