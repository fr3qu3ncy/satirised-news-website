        <p>The US and UK suddenly pulled troops from a Qatar military base because Trump's impending decision on Iran was apparently reason enough to "avoid getting blown up" by Iran.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: US and UK Pull Troops from Qatar Military Base, Trump Weighs Action Against Iran<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left everyone scratching their heads, the United States and the United Kingdom have suddenly pulled some personnel from the Al-Udeid air base in Qatar. Because, you know, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade – and also secretly withdraw troops to avoid getting blown up by Iran.<br/><br/>According to sources (aka rumors), this "precautionary measure" is allegedly a response to Donald Trump's impending decision on whether to take action against Iran over its crackdown on anti-government protests. Yeah, because nothing says "diplomatic effort" like a surprise troop withdrawal.<br/><br/>The Qatari government has issued a statement saying they're still cool with the US and UK being there, but only if they don't make too many fart jokes during staff meetings. Meanwhile, the Foreign Office in London has temporarily closed the British embassy in Tehran, because who needs diplomats when you can just tweet at each other?<br/><br/>This all started when Trump warned that the US would take "very strong action" against Iran if it executed protesters – which is code for "we're going to bomb some stuff and hope nobody gets hurt." But don't worry, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has assured us that they won't retaliate unless someone puts ketchup on their falafel.<br/><br/>And in a related story, the US Mission to Saudi Arabia has advised its personnel and citizens to "exercise increased caution" when visiting military installations – which is just code for "watch out for those pesky Iranian drones."<br/><br/>Now, we're not saying that Trump's got a crystal ball or anything (okay, fine, we are saying that), but it seems like someone's trying to avoid getting caught in the crossfire of another Middle East conflict. We mean, who needs allies when you can just have a bunch of nervous staff members hiding behind their desks?<br/><br/>So, let this be a lesson to all you world leaders out there: if you're going to start a war, at least make sure your Twitter followers know about it first.<br/><br/>Stay classy, guys!</p>
