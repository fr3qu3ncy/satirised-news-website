        <p>BREAKING: Lucknow Joins Exclusive Club of Cities with Food So Good, You'll Want to Marry It (But Not Really)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the city of Lucknow has been named a Creative City of Gastronomy by Unesco. Because, you know, that's exactly what the world was missing - another reason to eat more kebabs.<br/><br/>This news comes as a surprise to no one, especially not to Ranveer Brar, who said, "Better late than never. It should have come before." Yeah, because nothing says "better late than never" like being named to a list of cities with great food 20 years after everyone else figured it out.<br/><br/>Lucknow's cuisine is so good that it's been making people drool for centuries. In fact, the city's royal kitchens were the epicenter of culinary innovation back in the day. That's right, folks - the same kitchens where they created those melt-in-your-mouth kebabs that are basically a flavor bomb just waiting to blow your taste buds to kingdom come.<br/><br/>And don't even get me started on the biryani. It's like a symphony of flavors and textures all wrapped up in a delicious package. I mean, who needs love when you have biryani?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Lucknow is also home to some of the most amazing desserts you've ever laid eyes on (or tasted, for that matter). Take Makkhan Malai, for example - it's like a cloud in your mouth. Okay, maybe not exactly like a cloud, but it's definitely a lot like eating a fluffy pillow.<br/><br/>And let's not forget about the street food! Chaat, anyone? It's like a party in your mouth with all those spicy and tangy flavors going on.<br/><br/>So there you have it - Lucknow joins the exclusive club of cities with great food. Who knew being named to this list was the ultimate prize for cities? I mean, what's next? Will Paris be named a Creative City of... wait for it... Baguettes?<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the mayor of Paris has announced plans to start a "Bakeries Without Borders" initiative. It seems they're trying to follow in Lucknow's footsteps and become a city with great food too (but let's be real, they'll never catch up).<br/><br/>In conclusion, Lucknow's got some serious bragging rights now. Who needs world peace when you can have great food?</p>
