        <p>BREAKING: Chaos Ensues in Rhode Island as Two People Die and Nine Others Get Their Kicks<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two people were killed and nine others were left with some serious bruising (literally) after a gunman opened fire at Brown University in Providence, Rhode Island. The shooter, described as a person dressed in black, walked into a lecture hall and started firing... but not before tripping over a stray chicken that had wandered onto the campus.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim the chicken, which was wearing a tiny backpack and sunglasses, seemed to be enjoying the commotion it caused. "I mean, who needs a beach day when you can cause a mass shooting?" said one student, who wished to remain anonymous because they were still shaken by the experience.<br/><br/>Police have released an image of the person of interest, which appears to be a blurry picture of Nicolas Cage in his younger years. Authorities are urging anyone with information about the shooter's whereabouts to come forward, but only if they're willing to trade their phone for a chicken nugget and a side of fries.<br/><br/>The FBI has offered a $50,000 reward for any information leading to the capture of the gunman, which is roughly the cost of a decent pair of sneakers at this point. President Donald Trump weighed in on the situation, tweeting "Sad! So sad. Just remember folks, I'm still trying to get my wall built."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Brown University has canceled all remaining exams and classes for the semester, citing "unforeseen circumstances" involving a bunch of students running around like headless chickens. The university's president, Paxson, released a statement saying she was "deeply moved" by the students' ability to multitask while simultaneously freaking out.<br/><br/>In related news, Kendall Turner, an alumna from Durham Academy in North Carolina, has been identified as one of the injured students. Her aunt, Karina Gabit, said Turner was an aspiring neurosurgeon who was also secretly training to be a pastry chef. When asked about her niece's condition, Gabit replied "She's doing okay, but she still can't get that stupid chicken out of her head."<br/><br/>As the investigation continues, police are urging anyone with information to come forward – but only if they're willing to provide it while eating a plate of chicken wings and watching an endless loop of Nicolas Cage movies.</p>
