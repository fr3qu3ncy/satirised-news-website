        <p>BREAKING: UK and Canada Get Visa-Free Travel to China, Plus Free Whisky and a Personalized Kung Fu Master<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the world stunned, China has announced that British and Canadian passport holders will be able to travel to mainland China visa-free from 17 February. But that's not all - they'll also get free whisky at every airport, a personalized kung fu master to teach them how to kick butt like a pro, and a complimentary massage to soothe their jet-lagged muscles.<br/><br/>The news came as Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer was spotted sipping on a flask of fine Scotch whisky with Chinese President Xi Jinping in the Forbidden City. "We're thrilled to announce that our friendship is now stronger than ever," said Sir Keir, winking at the cameras. "And by stronger, I mean we've agreed to give each other's citizens free travel and whisky."<br/><br/>But it's not just about the booze - China has also promised to send a team of trained kung fu masters to every major city in the UK and Canada to teach locals how to defend themselves against marauding hordes of angry accountants. "It's all about national security," explained a spokesperson for the Chinese government. "We want our citizens to be able to kick some serious butt, just like their ancestors."<br/><br/>The visa-free travel policy is set to stay in effect until 31 December, or whenever someone tries to sneak into China with a tub of contraband cheese. In the meantime, British and Canadian passport holders can look forward to enjoying their free whisky and kung fu lessons without having to fill out any pesky paperwork.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Downing Street sources have confirmed that Sir Keir's official visit to China was actually just an excuse for him to try out his new kung fu moves in front of a live audience. "It was all about the people-to-people exchanges," said a spokesperson. "And by people-to-people exchanges, I mean Sir Keir showing off his impressive kicking skills."<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* BREAKING: Canada Confirms It Will Provide Free Poutine to British Tourists<br/>* China Announces Plans to Build Giant Wall Around UK to Keep Out Rogue Accountants<br/>* UK and Canada Agree to Share Secrets of Making Perfectly Crispy Bacon<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, including a special report on the best ways to get your hands on free whisky in China.</p>
