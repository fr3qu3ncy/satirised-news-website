    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Kyrylo Budanov Becomes President of Ukraine's Office, Gets Promoted to Spy Chief<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that his new chief of staff is none other than Kyrylo Budanov, the current head of Hur military intelligence. But wait, there's more! Budanov will also be taking on the role of President of Ukraine's Office... and Spy Chief.<br/><br/>That's right, folks! Zelensky has promoted Budanov to not one, not two, but three positions at once. It's like a Christmas miracle, except instead of presents, we're getting espionage, security breaches, and possibly even a few drones flying around Kyiv.<br/><br/>"I've decided to overhaul the role of President of Ukraine's Office," said Zelensky in a statement. "And by overhaul, I mean give it to this guy." He then handed Budanov a microphone and said, "Hey, you're in charge now! Good luck with that!"<br/><br/>In related news, Ukrainian Defense Minister Denys Shmyhal has been replaced by Mykhaylo Fedorov, the current minister of digital transformation. Because what Ukraine really needs right now is more drone operators.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the presidential office (i.e., a guy who works in the bathroom), Budanov's predecessor, Andriy Yermak, was forced to resign after his home was raided by anti-corruption agencies. But don't worry, folks, Yermak is not accused of any wrongdoing... unless you count embezzling $100m from Ukraine's energy sector.<br/><br/>In other news, Russia has accused Ukraine of killing 27 people in a New Year's attack on the occupied Kherson region. When asked for comment, Zelensky simply shrugged and said, "Hey, we're just trying to get some quality spy footage for our next Netflix series."<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>We've just received word that Kyrylo Budanov has been spotted wearing a tutu and practicing his spy moves in the presidential office. When asked about this development, Zelensky simply winked and said, "Don't worry, he's just getting into character for our next James Bond-esque adventure."<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! It's going to be a wild ride.<br/><br/>SIDEBAR:<br/><br/>We've also learned that Oleh Ivashchenko, the new foreign intelligence chief, has been secretly training a team of ninja warriors in the Ukrainian countryside. Sources close to the operation (i.e., a guy who works at the local convenience store) claim that Ivashchenko's ninjas are so stealthy, they can sneak up on a Russian spy without even making him blink.<br/><br/>WHAT'S NEXT?<br/><br/>Only time will tell, folks! But one thing is certain: with Kyrylo Budanov as President of Ukraine's Office and Spy Chief, you can bet your bottom dollar that things are about to get real interesting in Kiev.</p>
