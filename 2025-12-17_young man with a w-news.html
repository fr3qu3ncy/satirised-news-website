        <p>BREAKING: Rob Reiner's Son, Nick, Charged with Murder in Bizarre Case Involving Sausage Dogs and a Disco Ball<br/><br/>Los Angeles, CA - In a shocking turn of events, Nick Reiner, the 32-year-old son of Hollywood director Rob Reiner, has been charged with murder in connection with the deaths of his parents. But that's not all - sources close to the investigation reveal that the motive behind the brutal stabbing was none other than a dispute over who ate the last sausage dog from the neighborhood's annual Hot Diggity Dog Festival.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Nick Reiner was seen fleeing the scene in a 1969 Camaro with a "Disco Inferno" license plate, while his parents' lifeless bodies were found in their living room, surrounded by empty beer cans and a VHS player still playing "Top Gun". The killer's getaway car was later discovered parked outside a local KFC, where Nick had allegedly stopped to grab a bucket of fried chicken.<br/><br/>As the investigation unfolds, detectives have revealed that the victimized Rob Reiner was known for his infamous catchphrase "I'm not dead yet!", which he would often exclaim while dodging bullets in his beloved sitcom, "The Golden Girls". It's reported that Nick's lawyers are now using this catchphrase as a defense, claiming that their client simply wanted to play a prank on his unsuspecting parents.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, sources close to the Reiner family have revealed that the couple was planning to take Nick to see a showing of "Spinal Tap II: The End Continues" at the Egyptian Theatre in Los Angeles. But with Nick now facing murder charges, it seems that won't be happening anytime soon.<br/><br/>UPDATE: As news of the arrest broke, Donald Trump took to Twitter to express his outrage and demand "justice for Rob Reiner's sausage dogs". In a surprise move, Lady Gaga has also weighed in on the controversy, tweeting: "I'm not sure what's more shocking - Nick Reiner's alleged crimes or the fact that he still owes me money from our 2018 'Bad Romance' tour."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
