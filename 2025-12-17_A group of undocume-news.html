        <p>Breaking News:<br/><br/>"US Accused of Using Illegal Workers at Centre Processing Refugee Claims in South Africa"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has been accused of using Kenyan nationals without work permits to process applications for refugee status from white South Africans. Yes, you read that right - Kenyans who didn't have work permits were working with Afrikaners (that's what they call themselves) at a centre in South Africa.<br/><br/>The seven Kenyans involved in this scandal were arrested after intelligence reports revealed that people "had recently entered South Africa on tourist visas and had illegally taken up work" at the centre. I mean, who doesn't love a good tourist visa-turned-full-time-job? Am I right?<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! The US has been trying to reduce overall levels of migration, but they've made an exception for white South Africans. Yep, because nothing says "refugee" like being white and from South Africa.<br/><br/>According to the US embassy in South Africa, the processing of applications by white South Africans is being done by RSC Africa, a Kenyan-based refugee support centre operated by Church World Service (CWS). Because who needs a background check when you're working with the church?<br/><br/>And let's not forget about President Donald Trump's claim that Afrikaners are being subjected to a "genocide" in South Africa. You know, the one where he said they were being shot at? Yeah, no evidence of that happening. But hey, who needs facts when you've got Twitter?<br/><br/>In response to this scandal, South Africa has expressed concern that foreign officials appeared to have coordinated with undocumented workers and said it had reached out to the US and Kenya to resolve the matter. Meanwhile, Tommy Pigott, principal deputy spokesperson for the State Department, was like "Uh-oh, we're going to get in trouble now."<br/><br/>To make matters worse, the US has reduced its yearly intake of refugees from around the world from 125,000 to 7,500. That's right, folks - they've got more than enough room for Afrikaners but can't take in anyone else. Priorities, am I right?<br/><br/>All this drama is unfolding against the backdrop of South Africa's new land law that has Trump fuming. Because nothing says "good governance" like seizing land without compensation.<br/><br/>So there you have it - a good old-fashioned scandal involving Kenyans without work permits, white South Africans, and President Donald Trump's Twitter fingers. What's next?</p>
