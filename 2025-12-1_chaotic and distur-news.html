        <p>**BREAKING: "Targeted" Shooting at Children's Birthday Party Leaves Four Dead, 11 Injured, and a Trail of Chaos**<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, a shooting at a children's birthday party in California has resulted in four fatalities, including three kids. The victims were eight, nine, 14, and 21 years old. Yes, you read that right – 21! It's like the shooter thought he was at a Spring Break rave or something.<br/><br/>Eleven others were injured, one critically, which is just peachy. I mean, who doesn't love a good shooting? The partygoers were treated to a minute-long gunfight, because who needs cake and balloons when you can have bullets flying everywhere?<br/><br/>According to reports, the suspect is still on the loose, which is just fantastic. Because what's a good birthday party without a little "targeted" violence thrown in? Authorities are now scrambling to figure out why this happened, but let's be real, it's probably just another case of "gun violence gone wild."<br/><br/>In related news, Donald Trump has released a statement saying that the shooting is a "total disaster" and that he knows more about birthday parties than anyone. He also added that the party was "yuge," which, um, I guess is true.<br/><br/>Now, let's get to the good stuff – the reactions from local officials! Stockton City Councilwoman Mariela Ponce has offered a $5,000 reward for information leading to an arrest and conviction, because what's a little shooting without a cash prize, am I right?<br/><br/>And in other news, Emmanuel Lopez, the brother of one of the victims, is still trying to process the whole ordeal. "I'm just upset right now," he said, adding that his brother was a "good kid" who loved celebrating birthdays (irony alert!). He also mentioned that his 9-year-old daughter was among those injured and survived, because what's a party without a few bullet wounds?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Sheriff Patrick Withrow has confirmed that there were multiple shooters involved, but detectives need to confirm as much. Yeah, good luck with that.<br/><br/>The San Joaquin County Sheriff's Office is urging anyone with information or video footage to come forward, because who doesn't love a good "citizen's police blotter" entry?<br/><br/>And finally, California Governor Gavin Newsom has released a statement saying that the state will do whatever it takes to prevent such tragedies in the future...but only after he finishes his next campaign donation.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
