        <p>Vladimir Putin announced he's not planning a global takeover, but is instead focused on getting respect from Western leaders and securing a prime parking spot at IKEA.</p>

        <p>PUTIN SAYS HE'S NOT A WAR MACHINE, BUT THE BEAST FROM THE DEEP<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Vladimir Putin told BBC Russia editor Steve Rosenberg that he's not planning to take over the world... or at least not in the classical sense. "Western politicians created the current situation with their own hands," Putin said, adding that they're just jealous of his fabulous mustache.<br/><br/>When asked about his plans for the future of Russia, Putin replied, "I'm calling for greater respect from other Western leaders. You know, like when you finally get a parking spot right next to the entrance at IKEA." He also denied any plans to attack Europe, saying it's just a bunch of nonsense... much like Donald Trump's hair.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre twist, Catherine, the Princess of Wales, was spotted walking hand-in-hand with former French President Nicolas Sarkozy through the streets of Paris. When asked about their relationship, Sarkozy simply winked and said, "Je suis comme un fromage, je suis à l'abord de la crise!" (Translation: I'm like cheese, I'm at the forefront of a crisis!)<br/><br/>In other news, German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was overheard whispering to King Charles III during their joint prayer session with Pope Leo XIV that he's secretly training for the Olympic archery competition. "I've been practicing my arrow-throwing skills in the Chancellery basement," Scholz whispered, adding that he hopes to make it to the finals... but only if Germany wins the Eurovision Song Contest first.<br/><br/>And finally, a group of rowdy tourists were spotted reenacting their own version of the Great Louvre Heist outside the museum. "We just wanted to add some excitement to our trip!" one tourist exclaimed. Another added, "Plus, we heard the security guards are super lax... it's like they're trying to lose the priceless artwork or something!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
