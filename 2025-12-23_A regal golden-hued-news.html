        <h2>IT'S OFFICIAL: TRUMP TO BUILD GOLDEN FLEET OF BATTLESHEEPS WITH HIS FACE ON THEM - BECAUSE WHY NOT?!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>The US president has announced plans to build a "Golden Fleet" of Trump-branded battleships, complete with gold-plated hulls and his own face emblazoned on them, because why not?</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>THE TRUMP CLASS SHIP BUILDING BOOM: IT'S A GOLDEN FLEET OF FUN AND GAMES!<br/><br/>Oh boy, it's finally happening! The US president has announced plans to revive American shipbuilding after lagging behind China in naval capacity. And by "revive," we mean he's going all out with a "Golden Fleet" of Trump-branded battleships!<br/><br/>THE TRUMP CLASS: WHERE FUNCTION MEETS FASHION<br/><br/>Imagine the ultimate symbol of American power: a massive, gold-plated battleship emblazoned with Donald Trump's face. That's right, folks! The USS Defiant (yes, that's its name) will be equipped to carry an array of weapons, including hypersonic missiles and "extremely lethal" stuff that'll make your grandma go "aw shucks!" The Trump class ships will be the biggest, baddest, and most beautiful battleships ever built – with a price tag that'll make your wallet go "ouch!"<br/><br/>CHINA'S GOT NOTHING ON US... EXCEPT FOR EVERYTHING<br/><br/>Despite being behind China in shipbuilding capacity (and pretty much every other area), Trump is convinced that his new fleet will be the best thing since sliced bread. And who can blame him? I mean, have you seen those renderings of the Trump Class ships? They're so cool! The Chinese navy might have a few more battleships, but ours will have... um, more gold!<br/><br/>TRUMP: THE MAN WHO CAN'T RESIST A GOOD SELF-PLUG<br/><br/>In related news, President Trump has announced that he'll be naming every single ship in the fleet after himself. Because, why not? It's not like it's arrogance or anything (although, let's be real, it totally is). Just think of the fun you can have trying to get a straight answer out of him when asked about the ships' specifications: "What do you mean 'specifications'? You want to know how big they are? They're HUGE! The biggest! The best!"<br/><br/>UNLESS YOU COUNT THE TIME HE TRIED TO BUILD A WALL...<br/><br/>Remember that whole wall thingy he promised Mexico would pay for? Yeah, that didn't go so well. But hey, at least we can count on the Trump class ships to be built on time (and within budget – no promises, though). After all, what could possibly go wrong with a massive shipbuilding project led by the guy who brought you "alternative facts"?<br/><br/>SO, WHO'S READY TO JOIN THE GOLDEN FLEET?<br/><br/>The US Navy is currently recruiting sailors to man the Trump class ships. So, if you're looking for a career change that'll get you noticed on social media, now's your chance! Just don't forget to bring your sunscreen – we hear those gold-plated hulls can get pretty hot in the sun.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! This is gonna be a wild ride...</p>
