        <p>BREAKING: Iran's Supreme Leader Issues Threats, But Who Cares?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iran's supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has warned the US that any attack on his country would spark a regional conflict. Oh no, who didn't see this coming? The dude is basically saying, "Hey, don't mess with us, or we'll mess with you... and maybe some other countries too."<br/><br/>Khamenei's statement was made while he was sipping tea and eating baklava in his favorite cave. When asked for comment, a spokesperson said, "The ayatollah is just trying to sound tough, but honestly, who doesn't love a good game of cat and mouse with the US military?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has been busy tweeting about Iran's naval exercises in the Strait of Hormuz. He tweeted, "Just found out that Iran is doing some live-fire drills in the strait. Big deal! I've got a few live-fire drills planned for my next golf tournament." When asked to clarify, Trump said, "What? No, no, no. That's not what I meant. But seriously, folks, we're watching Iran closely."<br/><br/>In other news, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has been trying to negotiate with the US over Tehran's nuclear program. He was quoted as saying, "We're confident that we can achieve a deal... or at least get a really nice selfie with Trump." When asked about the status of the negotiations, Araghchi said, "Oh, they're going great! Just peachy."<br/><br/>The US has been building up its forces in the region, sending its aircraft carrier the USS Abraham Lincoln to the area. Iran's top security official Ali Larijani responded by saying, "We've got our own super-advanced military technology... like our patented 'Flying Vase' missile system." When asked for more information, Larijani said, "Uh, no comment."<br/><br/>As tensions continue to rise, protests have been breaking out in Iran. The protesters are demanding things like "Freedom" and "Human Rights," but really they just want better Wi-Fi. When asked about the situation, a protester said, "It's not about us; it's about our smartphones. We need better reception."<br/><br/>In unrelated news, Chuck Norris has been spotted in the region, punching out Iranian soldiers left and right. When asked for comment, Norris said, "I'm just trying to help with the negotiations... one punch at a time."</p>
