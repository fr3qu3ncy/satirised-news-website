        <h2>US Commerce Secretary's Fowl Claims Met with "Not Accurate" Response from India</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>The US Commerce Secretary's claims about Trump talks with India have been met with a "not accurate" response from India, leaving everyone scratching their heads over a rather fowl situation.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>INDIA SAYS "NOT ACCURATE" TO US COMMERCE SECRETARY'S CLAIMS ABOUT TRUMP TALKS<br/><br/>In a move that has left everyone scratching their head, India's foreign ministry spokesperson, Randhir Jaiswal, was quoted as saying "not accurate" to the claims made by US Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick about the trade deal breakdown between India and the US.<br/><br/>According to reports, Lutnick claimed that Prime Minister Narendra Modi didn't call President Donald Trump to discuss the trade deal, which is like saying a chicken didn't cluck. I mean, come on! Who doesn't know that chickens make loud noises? It's not like it's some sort of deep, dark secret.<br/><br/>But seriously, Lutnick said that India was given "three Fridays" to close the deal, and when they didn't, the US just went ahead and made deals with other countries. This is like saying, "Hey, I invited you to a party, but you didn't show up on time, so I just decided to have fun without you." Not exactly the most diplomatic way of putting it, if you ask me.<br/><br/>And then there's the part where Lutnick said that Trump's philosophy of making deals is like climbing a staircase. Yeah, because nothing says "diplomacy" like a staircase. I mean, who hasn't thought to themselves, "You know what would be great? If we could just climb a staircase and make a deal!" It's not like they're trying to negotiate a peace treaty or something.<br/><br/>India, on the other hand, is playing it cool, saying that Lutnick's characterization of the discussions between Delhi and Washington is "not accurate." You know, like when your friend tells you that you looked fat in those jeans, but you're all like, "Uh, no, I'm pretty sure I just got a little bigger around the middle."<br/><br/>But what really gets my goat (or should I say, my chicken cluck) is that Trump has been making some pretty wild claims about India and Modi lately. Like, remember when he said that he brokered a ceasefire between India and Pakistan after a four-day conflict? Yeah, because nothing says "diplomacy" like getting both sides to agree on something without even having a conversation.<br/><br/>Anyway, it looks like the US-India trade deal is still in limbo, but I'm sure everything will work out in the end. After all, as the great philosopher, Dolly Parton, once said, "If you want the rainbow, you gotta put up with the rain." Or something like that.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, folks! And remember, if anyone asks you what happened to the US-India trade deal, just say it was a chicken and egg problem.</p>
