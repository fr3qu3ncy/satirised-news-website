        <p>A comedy version of the Epstein files has been "released," featuring photoshopped pictures of Bill Clinton in a pool, Michael Jackson posing with Epstein, and Donald Trump trying to distract from allegations by posting about Clinton instead.</p>

        <p>EPSTEIN FILES EXPOSED: A COMEDY EDITION<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the long-awaited Epstein files have been released, and let's just say it's been a wild ride. We've got high-profile figures, suspicious pools, and more redacted documents than a teenager with acne.<br/><br/>BILL CLINTON TAKES THE POOL BY STORM<br/><br/>Former US President Bill Clinton has been spotted in some rather...interesting photos. He's seen swimming laps in a pool, looking like the epitome of cool (or at least, trying to). And who can forget his iconic hot tub pose? The man's got moves like Jagger...or should I say, Mick Jagger?<br/><br/>When asked about these new developments, Clinton's spokesperson had this to say: "Bill was just, uh, researching pool etiquette. Yeah, that's it. Pool etiquette." We're not buying it, Bill.<br/><br/>MICHAEL JACKSON GETS IN ON THE ACTION<br/><br/>The King of Pop himself, Michael Jackson, has been spotted posing with Epstein in some rather...unsettling photos. It looks like they're both trying to out-cool each other with their sunglasses and smirks. We're not sure what's more disturbing: the fact that MJ was hanging out with Epstein or the fact that Epstein thought it was a good idea to wear a bright yellow shirt.<br/><br/>ANDREW MOUNTBATTEN-WINDSOR GETS LOST IN THE LAP OF HISTORY<br/><br/>A photo has surfaced showing Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor lying across the laps of five people, all of whom are redacted. We're not sure what's more suspicious: the fact that Andrew is sprawled out like a human hammock or the fact that Ghislaine Maxwell is standing behind them, looking like she's trying to give some kind of awkward royal wave.<br/><br/>When asked about this development, Andrew had this to say: "I was just, uh, trying to get comfortable. Yeah, that's it. Comfortable." We're not buying it, Andy.<br/><br/>MICK JAGGER AND DIANA ROSS JOIN THE PARTY<br/><br/>It looks like the Rolling Stones' Mick Jagger and disco legend Diana Ross have both been implicated in the Epstein scandal. But wait, there's more! Chris Tucker has also made an appearance, because why not?<br/><br/>When asked about these new developments, a spokesperson for Mick Jagger had this to say: "Mick was just, uh, researching the art of poolside fashion. Yeah, that's it." Diana Ross simply shrugged and said, "Honey, I'm just trying to stay relevant."<br/><br/>TRUMP GETS IN ON THE ACTION (BUT NOT REALLY)<br/><br/>And finally, we've got a photo of Donald Trump allegedly introducing a 14-year-old girl to Epstein at Mar-a-Lago. But here's the thing: the Trump War Room is more interested in posting photos of Bill Clinton than actually addressing the allegations against their beloved leader.<br/><br/>When asked about this development, White House spokeswoman Abigail Jackson had this to say: "The Trump administration is committed to transparency and accountability...as long as it doesn't involve actual investigations or consequences. Yeah, that's it."<br/><br/>And there you have it, folks! The Epstein files have been released, and it's been a wild ride. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story (which will probably never develop into anything actually interesting).</p>
