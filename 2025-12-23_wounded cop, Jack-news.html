        <p>Miracle on 5th Avenue: Jack Hibbert, the Cop Shot in the Head and Shoulder, is Home for Christmas!<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Probationary Constable Jack Hibbert, who was shot in the head and shoulder during the infamous Bondi Beach attack, has been released from hospital just in time to ruin his family's holiday season. "We couldn't ask for anything more – having our Jack home, especially for Christmas, truly feels like a miracle... said his family, while simultaneously questioning their life choices.<br/><br/>As Jack sat on the couch, surrounded by festive decorations and the faint smell of hospital disinfectant, he couldn't help but feel like the luckiest guy in the world. "I mean, who needs a functioning eye when you can have a decent Christmas dinner?" he quipped, while his family winced in discomfort.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Jack's colleagues at the police department are rallying around him, bringing by casseroles and awkwardly trying to make small talk about the incident. "Hey, Jack! So, uh, how's your... eye doing?" one of them ventured, before quickly retreating back into their shell.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Jack has decided to use his newfound notoriety to launch a career in stand-up comedy. "I mean, who needs a steady job when you can make people laugh about being shot in the head?" he mused, while his family looked on in horror.<br/><br/>As for the suspected gunmen, Naveed Akram and his father Sajid, they're not too thrilled about Jack's new career plans either. "I mean, seriously, who needs a 'superhero' cop when you can have a pair of evil masterminds trying to take over the world?" Akram grumbled, before being hauled away by authorities for plotting more dastardly schemes.<br/><br/>In related news, the people of Bondi Beach are still reeling from the aftermath of the attack, and have taken to wearing 'I survived the Bondi Beach massacre' t-shirts as a way to cope. "It's like, we're all in this together, right?" said one local resident, while another chimed in with, "Yeah, and who needs a functioning eye when you can have a sweet new t-shirt?"<br/><br/>In conclusion, Jack Hibbert's homecoming is a true Christmas miracle – a testament to the power of hope, redemption, and really bad life choices.</p>
