        <p>PUTIN PROMISES NO MORE WARS... BUT ONLY IF YOU TREAT US WITH RESPECT AND A FREE PIZZA PARTY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Vladimir Putin has vowed to stop invading countries if the West treats Russia with respect and provides a free pizza party for all Russian citizens. The Russian President made this bold promise during a TV marathon that lasted almost four and a half hours, which was more like watching paint dry than an exciting live event.<br/><br/>When asked by the BBC's Steve Rosenberg whether there would be new "special military operations", Putin said, "There won't be any operations if you treat us with respect, if you respect our interests just as we've always tried to respect yours... and if you give us all a free pizza party on Friday nights."<br/><br/>Putin also claimed that claims of an attack on Europe were "nonsense" and that Russia was only planning to invade Ukraine's snack cabinet. "We're not interested in invading your lands," he said, "but we do love a good nacho cheese sauce".<br/><br/>The Russian President also addressed the issue of rising prices in Russia, saying, "Stop the crazy rise in prices on everything! Unless it's vodka, then that can go up all you want." He added that Russia's central bank was lowering interest rates to 16% and that this would make everyone happy... or at least, as happy as a Russian can be.<br/><br/>When questioned about Ukraine, Putin said, "We are ready to work with you - with the UK and with Europe in general and with the United States, but as equals, with mutual respect to each other. And if you don't agree, then we'll just have to go back to our old ways of invading your countries... or at least, that's what I've been told by my buddy, Putin Jr."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukraine officials said seven people were killed and 15 injured in a Russian missile strike on the country's southern Odesa region. When asked about this, Putin shrugged and said, "Oh, don't worry about it, those are just some pesky Ukrainians trying to ruin our fun".<br/><br/>In other news, the United States has announced that it will be sending a team of experts to Russia to teach them how to make a proper pizza. The team includes renowned pizzaiolos from Italy and a special guest appearance by Gordon Ramsay.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>In a surprise twist, Putin's promise of no more wars was met with a collective yawn from the international community. "Yeah, yeah, we've heard it all before," said a spokesperson for NATO. "We're not buying what he's selling... unless it comes with a free pizza".<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the people of Russia are rejoicing at the prospect of getting a free pizza party every Friday night. As one Russian citizen exclaimed, "Glory to Putin! Glory to Pizza Hut!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
