        <p>The Woman Who Was Supposed to Care for Saabirin Saylaan, But Ended Up Being a Total Bitch and Torturing Her<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a woman named Hodan Mohamud Diiriye was found guilty of torturing and killing 14-year-old orphan Saabirin Saylaan. Because, you know, who needs child protection laws when you have a loving aunt's family to take care of you? Diiriye's defense team argued that she was just trying to "toughen up" the young girl, but the judge was all like, "Uh no, dude, that's not how it works."<br/><br/>Diiriye had taken Saabirin in under the guise of caring for her, but what really happened was that she beat and tortured the poor kid. Like, who needs a spa day when you can just have your aunt's family rip off your fingernails and stab you repeatedly? The police investigation revealed that Diiriye had even recorded some of these "toughening up" sessions on her phone, including one particularly disturbing recording where she says, "I'm enjoying your pain." Classy.<br/><br/>The people of Galkayo, Somalia are still reeling from this heinous crime. Hundreds of women and young people took to the streets, waving signs that read "Justice for Saabirin" and calling for Diiriye's head on a platter. It's not every day you see a crowd of angry women chanting slogans while carrying wooden sticks and stones – it's like they're trying to recreate a scene from Game of Thrones or something.<br/><br/>As the investigation continues, many are questioning the role of traditional elders in these cases. You know, those wise guys who always seem to show up after the fact and say, "Hey, let's just settle this with some cash and a handshake, yeah?" Nope, not today, elders! The people want justice for Saabirin, and they won't rest until it's served.<br/><br/>Diiriye's husband, Abdiaziz Nor, was acquitted of murder but sentenced to one year in prison and fined $500 (£375) for negligence. Because, clearly, that's the punishment you deserve when you let your wife torture a 14-year-old girl to death – a slap on the wrist and a parking ticket.<br/><br/>In related news, a three-year-old boy was also abused in his father's home in Mogadishu, Somalia, but he didn't die because he's not as cool as Saabirin. A police officer arrested the perpetrator, because priorities, people!<br/><br/>The community is calling for greater child protection measures to be implemented, and we're all like, "Amen to that!" After all, who needs a functioning justice system when you have a bunch of angry women wielding wooden sticks?</p>
