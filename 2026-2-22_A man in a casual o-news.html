        <p>BREAKING: Armed Man Shot Dead After Trying to Sneak into Trump's Mansion with Shotgun and Fuel Can, Secret Service Says<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, an armed man was shot dead by the Secret Service after trying to sneak into Donald Trump's Mar-a-Lago mansion in Florida. But wait, it gets even better! The suspect, identified as Austin T Martin from North Carolina, was carrying a shotgun and fuel can, because you know what they say: "you can never be too prepared for a presidential assassination attempt".<br/><br/>As it turns out, Martin had been reported missing by his family, but he just couldn't wait to meet Trump in person. He decided to take a road trip from North Carolina to Florida, stopping at every fast food joint and truck stop along the way to fuel up (literally). And, because he was feeling extra adventurous, he decided to bring a shotgun and some gas for good measure.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump was busy tweeting about how much he loves his hairpiece in Washington D.C. When the Secret Service received reports of an armed man trying to sneak into Mar-a-Lago, they sprang into action. Agents were able to quickly surround Martin and order him to drop his shotgun and fuel can. But, because this guy was clearly a mastermind, he refused to comply and instead raised the shotgun in a threatening manner.<br/><br/>That's when things got real. The Secret Service fired their shots, but unfortunately for them, they missed Martin entirely. Instead of hitting him, they somehow managed to knock over a nearby ice cream truck, causing all the kids in the area to scream with excitement.<br/><br/>The incident has sparked a heated debate about whether or not it was really necessary for the Secret Service to use lethal force. "I mean, come on," said one Trump supporter. "The guy just wanted to take a selfie with Trump! What's the harm in that?" Another added, "And what's with all the fuss about the shotgun? It was just a little something he picked up at Walmart."<br/><br/>In related news, Trump has announced plans to build a wall around his mansion to prevent future assassination attempts. The wall will be made of solid gold and feature a moat filled with sharks. Because, you know, nothing says "security" like a few hundred sharp-toothed predators.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The FBI has launched an investigation into the incident, but sources close to the agency say they're having trouble getting anyone to cooperate because everyone involved is too busy playing Fortnite to answer their calls.</p>
