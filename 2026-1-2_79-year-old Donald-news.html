        <h2>YOU WON'T BELIEVE What Trump Reveals About His Daily Health Habits! 🤯👀</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>US President Donald Trump has revealed a string of bizarre health habits, including taking three times the recommended dose of aspirin daily, wearing compression socks he didn't like, and keeping makeup in his desk to cover up bruises on his hands.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Health Report Just Got a Whole Lot Weirder<br/><br/>In a shocking interview with The Wall Street Journal, US President Donald Trump revealed that he takes a daily dose of 325mg of aspirin - more than three times the recommended amount by doctors. And why's that? Because, as he so eloquently put it, "I don't want thick blood pouring through my heart." Yeah, because nothing says "heart healthy" like downing a handful of horse pills every day.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Trump also shared that he had undergone a CT scan at Walter Reed National Medical Center - not an MRI, mind you, just a regular ol' CT scan. Because, you know, those two are basically the same thing (insert eye-roll emoji here). And don't worry about his chronic venous insufficiency; Trump just puts on some fancy compression socks... or not, because "I didn't like them." Typical.<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about exercise. Trump was asked if he got regular physical activity, and his response? "I just don't like it. It's boring." Boring?! You mean like how boring it is to be a 79-year-old president with a penchant for making questionable health decisions? Yeah, that kind of boring.<br/><br/>But the cherry on top of this sundae of absurdity is when Trump revealed that he keeps makeup in his desk drawer to cover up any bruises on his hands. Because, you know, nothing says "presidential" like carrying around lip gloss and powder to conceal your battle scars. We're pretty sure that's not exactly what the Founding Fathers had in mind.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems Trump is taking a page straight out of the playbook of his predecessor, Joe Biden - who also struggled with age-related health issues (see: stumbling debate). But hey, at least Trump has the excuse of being a "little superstitious" about switching from his trusty 325mg aspirin regimen. Who needs science and reason when you've got superstition on your side?<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY... OR NOT, BECAUSE WE'RE ALL JUST TRYING TO SURVIVE IN A WORLD WHERE TRUMP IS PRESIDENT</p>
