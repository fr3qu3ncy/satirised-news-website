        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Ski Bar Owner Held as Potential Flight Risk<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Jacques Moretti, the French owner of the infamous Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana, Switzerland, has been held in custody as a potential flight risk. This comes after 40 people died in a deadly fire on New Year's Eve, with many more injured.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more!<br/><br/>As it turns out, Jacques wasn't the only one who was "flaming" hot that night. His wife, Jessica Moretti, was also present at the bar, and sources close to the investigation revealed that she was seen dancing on the table while wearing a pair of flamingo-print pants.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre twist...<br/><br/>The prosecutors have announced that they will be seeking the help of none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to determine whether Jacques is indeed a flight risk. The Rock, known for his tough-guy persona and ability to lift heavy objects, was seen arriving at the courthouse in a sleek black helicopter, sporting a pair of shades and a confident smirk.<br/><br/>But what about the victims?<br/><br/>As the families of the deceased gathered outside the courtroom, they couldn't help but notice a group of cats dressed in tiny ski jackets, holding signs that read "Justice for the Victims." When asked to comment, one of the feline protesters simply said, "Meow, we're just trying to bring some comfort to those who have suffered."<br/><br/>And in other news...<br/><br/>The mayor of Crans-Montana, Nicolas Feraud, was seen sipping on a cup of coffee while nervously flipping through his phone. When asked about the lack of safety inspections at Le Constellation, he simply shrugged and said, "Well, you know what they say: 'an inspection is like a hug for your bar – it's nice to have one every now and then, but not too often, or it gets awkward.'"<br/><br/>In related news...<br/><br/>The Swiss government has announced that they will be implementing new laws requiring all bars in the country to have at least three safety inspections per year. Additionally, they will be introducing a new tax on champagne bottles with sparklers attached, citing concerns over public safety.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates!<br/><br/>This is a developing story, and we'll keep you posted as more information becomes available. In the meantime, our thoughts are with the victims and their families. May the force be with them, and may they find some semblance of justice in this chaotic world.</p>
