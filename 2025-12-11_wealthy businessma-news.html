        <p>COMEDY EDITION<br/><br/>BREAKING: TRUMP LAUNCHES "GOLD CARD" IMMIGRATION SCHEME, BECAUSE WHO NEEDS A GREEN CARD WHEN YOU CAN BUY ONE FOR $1M?<br/><br/>In a shocking move, President Donald Trump has launched a new immigration scheme that's almost as exciting as a Kardashian wedding – The Gold Card! Because who needs to wait five years for a green card when you can pay at least $1 million to jump the queue?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (aka Don Jr.'s Instagram account), the Gold Card is like a Times Square billboard on steroids. It's bright, shiny, and guaranteed to make your wallet cry itself to sleep every night. But hey, it's worth it for that sweet, sweet American citizenship, right?<br/><br/>Trump, in a rare display of self-awareness, tweeted: "The Trump Gold Card is Here! Unlock life in America... and by 'life', I mean a private jet, a Times Square billboard, and a permanent seat on the next season of The Apprentice."<br/><br/>To be eligible for this golden ticket to America, applicants must demonstrate that they'll bring a "substantial benefit" to the country. Substantial being code for "we want people who can pay off our national debt with their private jets".<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Businesses sponsoring employees are required to cough up $2 million, along with additional fees because, you know, bureaucracy is expensive. And if that's not enough, a "platinum" version of the card will soon be available for the low, low price of $5 million – perfect for that special someone in your life who loves diamonds and a private island.<br/><br/>Individuals are also required to pay a non-refundable $15,000 processing fee before their application is reviewed. But hey, at least you get a nice pen with the Gold Card logo on it, right?<br/><br/>When asked about the criticism surrounding this scheme, Trump responded: "What's not to love? It's like a Vegas casino – we'll take your money and give you a shiny new card that says 'you're American now, buddy'!"<br/><br/>As one Twitter user pointed out, "This is basically just a way for rich people to buy their way into America... said no one ever."</p>
