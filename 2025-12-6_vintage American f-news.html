        <p>BREAKING: Trump Administration Withdraws Free Entry on MLK Day and Juneteenth, Replaces with Flag Day and a Big Birthday Bash<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left many scratching their heads, the Trump administration has withdrawn free entry to national parks on Martin Luther King Jr. Day and Juneteenth, effective immediately. But wait, there's more! The agency is replacing these two fee-free days with Flag Day, which just so happens to be President Donald Trump's birthday.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (okay, it was just a guy in a funny hat), this change is part of President Trump's "modernisation" plan for the National Park Service. Because, you know, nothing says "modernisation" like taking away free entry on holidays that celebrate civil rights and the end of slavery.<br/><br/>And if you thought that was ridiculous, just wait until you hear about the new fee-free entrance day: Flag Day! That's right, folks, this is now a holiday where Americans can visit national parks for free, while everyone else has to shell out some cash. Because, as President Trump so eloquently put it, "If you're not American, you should pay for the privilege of visiting our great national parks."<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks, there's more good news! The new fee structure also includes a special discount for Americans who are willing to watch a 3-hour video about the history of the US flag before entering the park. It's like a free bonus feature on your national park visit!<br/><br/>And if you thought that was just a bunch of hot air, think again! The Trump administration has already begun implementing this new fee structure, with reports of long lines and angry tourists at national parks across the country.<br/><br/>In related news, the Trump administration has also announced plans to replace all National Park Service rangers with a team of highly trained, extremely patriotic squirrel mascots. Because, as one White House spokesperson put it, "Who needs actual park rangers when you can have squirrels in tiny hats?"<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The Trump administration's bold new plan for national parks: take away free entry on holidays that celebrate civil rights and the end of slavery, replace them with a holiday that celebrates President Trump's birthday, and hire squirrel mascots to do all the work. It's a bold new era in American history, and we can't wait to see what other surprises are in store for us!<br/><br/>UPDATE: The National Park Service has announced plans to hold a special "Squirrel Fest" celebration on Flag Day, complete with live music, dancing squirrels, and a special appearance by President Trump himself. It's going to be a real nutty party!</p>
