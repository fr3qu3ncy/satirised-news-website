        <p>BREAKING: Police 'Shot in the Front' Says NSW Premier, Because Apparently That's a Thing Now<br/><br/>In a bizarre press conference held on the sun-kissed beaches of Bondi, New South Wales Premier Chris Minns defended the police response to the recent shooting, claiming that officers were "shot in the front" by the two gunmen. Witnesses, who are now being referred to as "expert analysts," suggested that police were too slow to disarm the perpetrators, but Minns was having none of it.<br/><br/>"I mean, what's next? Are they going to say we didn't provide enough donuts at the scene?" said Minns, his voice dripping with disdain. "These officers put their lives on the line and I'm proud of them. They were shot in the front, for goodness' sake! That's like saying a vegan walked into a steakhouse – it just doesn't compute."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, police Commissioner Mal Lanyon was seen nodding enthusiastically in the background, possibly trying to remember what he had for breakfast that morning.<br/><br/>As the investigation continues, authorities have revealed that the younger gunman, Naveed Akram, had been under surveillance since 2019 due to his associations with a secret society of accountants. "We had no reason to believe he was a risk of violence," said Lanyon, before quickly adding, "unless he's planning on using Excel to calculate his next move – then we're on high alert."<br/><br/>Dr Vincent Hurley, a former police officer and expert in all things policing, weighed in on the matter, saying that responding to a mass shooting is like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and being chased by a pack of wild animals. "There's no training for this sort of thing," he said. "Unless you count watching Netflix documentaries about police procedurals – then we're all experts."<br/><br/>In related news, the Bondi Beach shooting has been ruled out as a possible plot point in the next season of "Game of Thrones."</p>
