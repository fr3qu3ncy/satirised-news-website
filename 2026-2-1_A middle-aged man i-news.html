        <p>EPSTEIN'S MONEY LAUNDERING SCANDAL: MANDELSON'S UNDERWATER SHOCK<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Lord Mandelson has been accused of receiving $75,000 from Jeffrey Epstein's bank accounts. The payments, which took place between 2003 and 2004, were made to accounts linked to the former UK ambassador to the US.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! In a bizarre twist, images of Mandelson in his underwear have surfaced in the latest tranche of Epstein files. He is seen standing next to a woman, whose face has been strategically redacted. We can only assume she's trying to cover up her embarrassment at being photographed with him.<br/><br/>Mandelson claims he has no record or recollection of receiving the sums and doesn't know if the documents are authentic. We're not buying it, Pete. You're like a cat burglar – always on the prowl for a quick buck.<br/><br/>The payments were made to accounts linked to Reinaldo Avila da Silva, Mandelson's partner at the time. We can only assume he was using the money to fund his extensive collection of velvet suits and disco balls.<br/><br/>When asked about the allegations, Housing Secretary Steve Reed said, "You're talking about things that happened more than 20 years ago...there was no knowledge" about what was going on at that time. Yeah, right, Steve. You were probably too busy having a pint down at the pub to notice Mandelson's shady dealings.<br/><br/>In other news, Melania Trump's director Brett Ratner has been spotted cuddling with a mystery woman in Epstein's files. We can only assume she's trying to make up for her lack of relevance by posing with Epstein's old pals.<br/><br/>LA 2028 Olympics chief "deeply regrets" flirtatious emails with Ghislaine Maxwell. Yeah, no kidding. You should've been more careful who you were sending those saucy emails to, mate.<br/><br/>And finally, a second Epstein victim claims she was sent to the UK for sex with Prince Andrew. Talk about a bad case of jet lag.</p>
