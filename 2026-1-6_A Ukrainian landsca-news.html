        <p>BREAKING: UK and France Announce Plans to Send Troops to Ukraine, But Only if They Can Bring Their Own Porta-Potties<br/><br/>LONDON/PARIS - In a shocking move, the United Kingdom and France have announced plans to send troops to Ukraine, but only if they can bring their own porta-potties. The announcement was made by UK PM Sir Keir Starmer after a meeting of Ukraine's allies in Paris, where they also discussed the finer points of military strategy with Jared Kushner, son-in-law of Donald Trump and renowned expert on all things "stable genius".<br/><br/>According to sources close to the negotiations, the UK and France have agreed to establish "military hubs" across Ukraine, but only if they can bring their own catering team, led by celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay. "We need to make sure our troops are well-fed and happy," said a spokesperson for the UK government. "I mean, who wants to eat nothing but freeze-dried meals in the middle of a war zone?"<br/><br/>The plans were met with enthusiasm from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been vocal about his desire for Western support in the fight against Russia. However, when asked if he had any concerns about the UK and France's porta-potty requirements, Zelensky simply shrugged and said, "Hey, as long as they bring their own toilet paper, I'm cool with it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russian President Vladimir Putin has released a statement saying that he is "utterly baffled" by the UK and France's demands. "What's next? Are they going to ask for their own personal movie screens and popcorn machines?" Putin quipped.<br/><br/>In related news, the US has announced plans to take the lead in monitoring a ceasefire, but only if they can bring their own team of accountants to keep track of all the expenses. "We need to make sure our efforts are fiscally responsible," said a spokesperson for the US government. "I mean, who wants to get stuck with a bill for billions of dollars' worth of military equipment?"<br/><br/>As tensions continue to rise in Ukraine, one thing is clear: when it comes to international diplomacy, nothing says "serious business" like a good porta-potty and a reliable team of accountants.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The BBC has just received word that the UK and France have agreed to bring their own team of accountants and caterers to the negotiating table. We will provide live updates as this situation develops.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS BREAKING STORY!</p>
