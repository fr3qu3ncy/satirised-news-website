    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: White House Chief of Staff Susie Wiles Goes Rogue on Vanity Fair<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Susie Wiles, the chief of staff to President Donald Trump, has come out swinging against Vanity Fair, calling their recent article "a disingenuously framed hit piece" that left out "significant context." But what's really going on here?<br/><br/>Sources Close to Wiles Reveal:<br/><br/>Insiders claim that Wiles was having a glass (or two) of Chardonnay during the interviews with Vanity Fair, which may have contributed to her... let's say, colorful descriptions of Trump and his cabinet members. "She was like a teenager on Red Bull," said one source, who wished to remain anonymous. "We're pretty sure she had a few sips too many."<br/><br/>The Real Reason Wiles Called Trump an "Alcoholic":<br/><br/>It turns out that Wiles' own father was a bit of a heavy drinker back in the day. In fact, he was so fond of the sauce that he once tried to drive a horse and carriage through the White House lawn while singing "I Will Survive." It's no wonder Wiles has a soft spot for Trump – they're basically two peas in a pod (or rather, two drunks at a frat party).<br/><br/>And What About JD Vance?<br/><br/>Apparently, Wiles called Vice President JD Vance a "conspiracy theorist" because she's convinced he's secretly working with Elvis Presley on a new line of hoverboards. It's true – we've heard rumors too.<br/><br/>Elon Musk: The Real Hero of This Story<br/><br/>Wiles also had some choice words for tech billionaire Elon Musk, describing him as an "avowed Ketamine user" who sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB (Executive Office Building). But what she really meant to say is that Musk is secretly a ninja warrior, fighting against evil forces that seek to control the world's supply of avocados.<br/><br/>The Real Reason Wiles Left Out Context:<br/><br/>It turns out that Vanity Fair asked Wiles about her secret love of 80s hair metal music and her desire to start a band with Trump. But when she mentioned that they're both huge fans of Bon Jovi, the magazine just... moved on. It's like they were trying to cover up something.<br/><br/>The White House Responds:<br/><br/>In a statement, Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said that Wiles is "a steady leader" and that the entire administration is grateful for her help in achieving President Trump's most successful first 11 months in office (or at least his own personal best time to cook a frozen pizza).<br/><br/>And So It Goes...<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems like Susie Wiles is still trying to live down her glory days as a contestant on "The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills" and has simply become too comfortable with being the most powerful woman in Trump's White House.</p>
