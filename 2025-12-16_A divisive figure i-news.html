        <p>BREAKING: Trump Criticizes Dead Hollywood Director, Again<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the nation stunned, US President Donald Trump has once again taken to social media to criticize a deceased Hollywood director. This time, it's Rob Reiner, who passed away alongside his wife Michele last weekend.<br/><br/>Trump, known for his love of Twitter and his disdain for anyone who disagrees with him, took to Truth Social (because, why not?) to call Reiner "very bad for our country" and claim that his death was related to "Trump derangement syndrome." Because, you know, people are so upset about Trump that they just can't help but kill each other.<br/><br/>When asked by reporters about his comments, Trump repeated his criticism of Reiner, calling him a "deranged person" who was somehow involved in the Russia collusion hoax. Yes, because that's exactly what happens when someone dies – we immediately start pointing fingers and making accusations.<br/><br/>In related news, it appears that Trump has a special talent for being tone-deaf and insensitive, even in the face of tragedy. Who needs empathy or compassion when you can just tweet about how great you are?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump's fellow Republicans have distanced themselves from his comments, with some calling them "inappropriate" and "disrespectful." But don't worry, folks – Trump will probably just blame it on the deep state.<br/><br/>Update: In a bizarre twist, Trump has now claimed that Reiner's son, Nick, is responsible for his parents' deaths. Because, you know, it's always the kid who does it. When asked for evidence, Trump simply shrugged and said, "I'm telling you, folks, I know what I'm talking about."</p>
