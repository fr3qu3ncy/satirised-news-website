        <p>BREAKING: Satellite Images Reveal RSF's Desperate Attempt to Cover Up Mass Killings in El-Fasher, but all they found were some guy's disco party<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, researchers from Yale University have discovered that Sudan's paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF) has been trying to cover up mass killings in the city of el-Fasher by burying and burning bodies. But what the researchers actually found was a massive disco party, complete with flashing lights, polyester suits, and a playlist full of Bee Gees hits.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the research team, the satellite images revealed clusters of people gathering in multiple locations, not to dispose of dead bodies, but to get their groove on. "We were expecting to see evidence of mass killings," said Dr. John Smith, lead researcher on the project. "But what we actually saw was a group of people dancing the night away like it's 1979."<br/><br/>The RSF had drawn international condemnation amid reports of executions and crimes against humanity when its fighters captured the city in October. But now, it seems that their true crime was having the worst taste in music. The images also show more than 80 clusters located outside of the city, which, the researchers say, shows that the RSF was actually trying to get some fresh air while they were dancing.<br/><br/>The HRL's report said the RSF "engaged in a systematic multi-week campaign to destroy evidence of its widespread mass killings... and also to find a decent DJ." The paramilitary group has been fighting Sudan's regular army since April 2023, when a power struggle between the two parties erupted into a brutal civil war. But it seems that their true enemy is actually each other's taste in music.<br/><br/>A SIMPLE GUIDE TO WHAT IS HAPPENING IN SUDAN (But mainly about disco)<br/><br/>UPDATE: RSF Leader Gen Mohamed Hamdan Dagalo has issued a statement saying "We meant to cover up mass killings, not start a dance craze."<br/><br/>The United Nations (UN) has described the conflict as the world's worst humanitarian disaster. But now, it seems that the real disaster is the UN's playlist. After 18 months of besieging el-Fasher, the RSF captured the city - a major victory pushing the army out of its last foothold in the vast Darfur region. The UN was among the many global voices accusing the RSF of massacring civilians as el-Fasher fell. But it turns out they were just trying to get some peace and quiet while they danced.<br/><br/>The HRL has been monitoring the situation in the city for months, and its latest report is part of efforts to understand the extent of the violence suffered by the city's residents. Fresh analysis of satellite imagery found clusters in multiple locations changing in size in the weeks after el-Fasher fell, which, the researchers say, demonstrates continued efforts by the RSF to clean up evidence of massacres... and also to find a decent disco bar.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* How Trump's Pledge to Tackle Sudan Atrocities Could Play Out (But mainly about how he wanted to join the dance party)<br/>* 'I Saw Them Driving Over Injured People' - The Terrifying Escape from War in Sudan (But really they were just trying to get away from the bad music)<br/>* Sudan in Danger of Self-Destructing as Conflict and Famine Reign (And also because their taste in music is so bad)</p>
