        <p>In a shocking move, the Oscars are ditching traditional TV and streaming exclusively on YouTube for free starting 2029, because who needs a big screen when you can watch Will Smith on your phone?</p>

        <p>THE OSCARS GETS A NEW STREAMING SERVICE, AND IT'S NOT JUST ANY OLD PLATFORM...<br/><br/>In a shocking move that's got the whole of Hollywood talking (and by "whole of Hollywood" we mean our mate Dave from the video shop down the road), the Academy Awards have ditched ABC and are now streaming exclusively on YouTube.<br/><br/>That's right, folks, as of 2029, you'll be able to watch all the glamour and drama of the Oscars live and for free on your phone or computer. No more awkwardly trying to fit a huge flat-screen TV in your living room; no more pesky cable subscription fees; just pure, unadulterated streaming bliss.<br/><br/>And let's be real, who needs a big screen when you can watch the likes of Will Smith and Denzel Washington on your phone? I mean, it's not like you'll have to worry about spoilers or anything...<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (aka our mate Dave again), the Academy signed a multi-year deal with YouTube that will give the platform exclusive global rights to the Oscars until 2033. That's right, folks; for the next few years, you'll be able to watch all the glamour and drama of Tinseltown on YouTube.<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking: "But wait, what about ABC?" Well, it seems that ABC is still getting a few more years out of this whole Oscars thing. They'll still host the show for the next three telecasts, because who needs to cut costs and streamline operations when you can just keep doing things the same way they've always been done?<br/><br/>The Academy's CEO, Bill Kramer, was quoted as saying that this partnership with YouTube will allow them to "expand access to the work of the Academy to the largest worldwide audience possible". Which, let's be real, is just a fancy way of saying "we want more people to watch our show".<br/><br/>And YouTube CEO Neal Mohan was equally excited about the whole thing, calling the Oscars "one of our essential cultural institutions" (whatever that means). He went on to say that partnering with the Academy will "inspire a new generation of creativity and film lovers while staying true to the Oscars' storied legacy". Which is just a fancy way of saying "we're going to make more money off this deal".<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks; the Oscars are now streaming on YouTube. Who's excited? (Spoiler alert: it's not me).<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, the entire cast and crew of "The Matrix" have been replaced with a bunch of cats in fur coats, and the new movie is going to be called "The Purr-xus". Just thought you'd like to know.</p>
