        <p>BREAKING: Craziness Unfolds in Bolivia as Plane Carrying Banknotes Crashes, Police Fire Tear Gas to Disperse Crowds Trying to Steal Money<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left everyone scratching their heads, a Bolivian air force cargo plane carrying banknotes crashed in the western city of El Alto, killing at least 20 people and injuring many more. But what's even crazier is that crowds tried to steal the scattered banknotes, prompting police to fire tear gas to disperse them.<br/><br/>The plane, which was arriving from Santa Cruz, skidded off the runway and hit nearby vehicles, causing massive destruction. Witnesses reported a heavy hailstorm with lightning when the plane went down, but it's unclear what caused the crash.<br/><br/>As news crews were covering the accident, individuals trying to steal the money attacked them with "unusual violence," according to the National Association of Journalists of Bolivia. A mobile TV unit was directly targeted, while other journalists suffered serious injuries while carrying out their work.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Bolivia's Minister of Defence, Marcelo Salinas, said that the banknotes had no legal value since they hadn't been issued by the Central Bank and didn't have serial numbers. "Trying to use this money is a crime," he warned. "We also ask all those who are engaging in acts of vandalism in this area to refrain from doing so and to respect the mourning and grief we are experiencing at this difficult time."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, El Alto International Airport was temporarily closed following the crash, and Bolivia's health ministry issued an urgent appeal for blood donations.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even crazier! Former Bolivian President Luis Arce, who was arrested in a corruption probe earlier this month, suddenly appeared at the crash site wearing a navy suit with a white shirt. He was seen walking around, looking very serious, while carrying a bunch of bananas. When asked what he was doing there, he simply shrugged and said, "Just trying to help, man."<br/><br/>And just when you thought it couldn't get any more surreal, Freddy Krueger from the A Nightmare on Elm Street franchise suddenly appeared at the crash site, wielding his iconic glove and saying, "One, two, Freddy's coming for you..."<br/><br/>As police tried to restore order, a group of mariachi musicians appeared out of nowhere, singing and dancing in front of the crashed plane. They were joined by a troupe of flamenco dancers who were wearing nothing but their underwear.<br/><br/>The incident has left everyone stunned, wondering what could have caused such chaos and confusion. As one witness put it, "It's like something out of a bad comedy movie."<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Bolivian government has announced that they will be providing compensation to the families of those killed in the crash, as well as offering free hugs to anyone who needs them.<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre coda to this already crazy story, a giant inflatable unicorn suddenly appeared at the crash site, playing a rendition of "Who Let the Dogs Out?" on a kazoo.</p>
