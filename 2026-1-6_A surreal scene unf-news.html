        <h2>BREAKING: Cows in Sombreros Disrupt Live BBC Report, Maduro's Venezuela on Brink of Collapse (But Who Knows?)</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>The BBC's Cuba correspondent Will Grant reports on the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba, but his live report is hilariously interrupted by cows wearing sombreros and playing maracas, and his own questionable fashion sense.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>The BBC's Cuba correspondent, Will Grant, explains what's the nature of the relationship between Venezuela and Cuba...or does he?<br/><br/>You know, folks, I was at the local café in Havana sipping on a mojito when I stumbled upon the most fascinating news story. It seems that Nicolás Maduro's Venezuela has been having a close relationship with Cuba, but with Maduro gone after a military operation in which he was seized by a team of ninjas (no one knows for sure), Havana could be exposed if oil supply collapses like a failed soufflé.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Trump suggested on Sunday that US military intervention in the country wasn't needed because Cuba is "ready to fall" – much like my Aunt Mildred's famous chocolate cake after she added an extra pinch of salt. The BBC's Cuba correspondent, Will Grant, reports from Cúcuta, on the Colombia-Venezuela border, where he stumbled upon a group of cows wearing tiny sombreros and playing maracas.<br/><br/>As I was interviewing the cows (who were actually quite articulate), I asked them about their take on the situation. "Moooving in the right direction," said Bessie, one of the cows. When I pressed for more information, she whispered to me that it was all a plot by El Chapo to steal the world's largest sombrero.<br/><br/>But let's get back to reality (or what passes for it). According to Will Grant, Venezuela and Cuba have been "BFFs" since time immemorial. It turns out that they share a love for salsa dancing, cigars, and playing dominoes until the wee hours of the morning. Who knew?<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "What about the oil supply?" Well, let me tell you, it's a bit like my Aunt Mildred's secret recipe for the fluffiest pancakes in town – no one knows exactly how she does it, but somehow, someway, Venezuela and Cuba have managed to make their relationship work despite all odds.<br/><br/>And speaking of odds, did I mention that Will Grant was spotted wearing a pair of platform shoes and a mullet wig during his live report? It's all part of the BBC's new "edgy" approach to news broadcasting – think Top Gear meets The Great British Baking Show.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems that Venezuela and Cuba are more than just neighbors – they're like two peas in a pod, or rather, like my Aunt Mildred's famous chocolate cake and her secret recipe for the fluffiest pancakes in town. One is always ready to fall, but somehow, someway, they manage to rise above the chaos.<br/><br/>And that's it from me, folks! Don't forget to tune in next time when I'll be reporting live from the set of The Great British Baking Show...or will I?</p>
