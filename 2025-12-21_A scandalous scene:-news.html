        <p>BREAKING: US Lawmakers Who Pushed for Transparency in Epstein Files Now Blaming DOJ for Not Releasing Enough Nipple Photos<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US Department of Justice (DOJ) has been accused by lawmakers of not releasing enough documents related to the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein. But what's really going on here? It seems like the DOJ is just trying to keep the good stuff for themselves.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, the DOJ was overheard whispering to each other in a conference room, "You know, we should probably just redact the parts with the naked people and the kiddie pool." When asked about this, a spokesperson for the DOJ replied, "Uh, no comment. We're just trying to protect the victims' identities... and our dignity."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, survivors of Epstein's abuse are left feeling frustrated and disappointed. One survivor, Liz Stein, was overheard saying, "I just want all the evidence out there, but it seems like they're more interested in keeping the secrets than serving justice." When asked about her concerns, she added, "You know, I'm starting to think that Ghislaine Maxwell's cat is the only one who really knows what's going on here."<br/><br/>In other news, the released documents have revealed some interesting connections between Epstein and various high-profile figures. It appears that Epstein was buddies with a certain former US President, Donald Trump, and even introduced him to a 14-year-old girl at Mar-a-Lago. When reached for comment, Trump replied, "Fake news! I had no idea what was going on... unless you count the time I accidentally invited myself to Epstein's birthday party and ended up getting roped into a game of Truth or Dare."<br/><br/>Other notable mentions in the released documents include:<br/><br/>* A photo of former President Bill Clinton sitting on a couch with Epstein, looking like they're about to get in trouble for sneaking out of the house after curfew.<br/>* A picture of Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor (yes, that's Prince Andrew) smiling awkwardly next to a framed photo of himself and Epstein, captioned "Best buds forever!"<br/>* A document detailing Epstein's alleged introduction of Michael Jackson to a 14-year-old girl, complete with a hand-drawn diagram of the Jackson family tree.<br/>* A collection of nude photos and paintings that seem to be from an art class gone wrong.<br/><br/>And in a shocking twist, it appears that the DOJ has been withholding some files, including one featuring a group of framed photos on a desk with Bill Clinton, the Pope, and Trump all making silly faces. When asked about this, a DOJ spokesperson replied, "Uh, we must have just... uh... misplaced those files."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, folks!</p>
