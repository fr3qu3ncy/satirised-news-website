        <p>**CYCLONE CHAOS: 500 GONE, THOUSANDS INJURED, AND SOMEONE'S MOM LEFT HER KITTENS ALONE**<br/><br/>Indonesia was hit with a rare cyclone that made everyone go "what the heck?!", leaving over 500 people missing, thousands injured, and some really bad hair days. The floods, which were caused by the cyclone's evil plan to ruin everyone's lives, affected three provinces: Aceh, North Sumatra, and West Sumatra. Because, you know, one province is never enough.<br/><br/>Rescue workers were seen walking on water (just kidding, they had boats... or not) trying to reach the affected areas. It was like a scene from "The Walking Dead," but instead of zombies, it was just people trying to survive in waist-deep water and mud. Oh, and some guy named Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson showed up with his famous smile and said, "Can you smell what the Rock is cooking?" And everyone was all like, "Uh, no dude, we're trying to find food here."<br/><br/>A local resident, Mariana, was quoted as saying, "Watching the excavators, seeing how thick the mud is… I keep thinking, what condition will my child be in when they find him? Will he still be intact? My mother, my brother-in-law… Looking at how it is here, maybe their faces won't even be recognisable any more." And then she burst into tears and ran away screaming, "My kittens! Who's going to take care of my precious little furballs?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Prabowo Subianto showed up in a helicopter, wearing a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt, pointing at himself. He said, "We face this disaster with resilience and solidarity... Our nation is strong right now, able to overcome this." And everyone was like, "Uh-huh, sure buddy, while we're over here trying to find food and shelter."<br/><br/>As the situation worsened, people started to get creative. In Central Aceh, they used Starlink devices to contact their loved ones... or charge their phones... or play Fortnite. Because priorities, right?<br/><br/>The government was criticized for being unprepared, which is code for "we had a meeting, but forgot to bring snacks." Some folks even blamed the floods on climate change, saying it's like that one aunt who always complains about everything.<br/><br/>In related news, the cat of the year award has been given to Mariana's kittens, who have somehow managed to survive this mess without anyone noticing. They're now living their best lives, eating all the scraps they can find, and plotting their next move to take over the world... or at least the local cat cafe.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
