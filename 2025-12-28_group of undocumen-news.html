        <p>BREAKING: Hondurans Scramble to Send Money Home as Trump's Immigration Crackdown Causes Economic Boom<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Honduras has experienced a surge in remittances from undocumented immigrants living in the United States, thanks to President Donald Trump's immigration crackdown. But it's not all good news for the country - I mean, who needs a functioning economy when you can have a bunch of scared Hondurans sending money back home?<br/><br/>According to sources, Elías Padilla, a would-be immigrant from Honduras, had been saving up to make the journey to the US as an undocumented worker. But after seeing images of ICE agents dragging people away in zip-ties, he decided to put his plans on hold. "I don't want to end up like that guy with the mustache," Padilla said, referring to a picture of Trump.<br/><br/>Padilla's change of heart has been welcomed by the architects of Trump's immigration policies, who are thrilled that their efforts have led to an unexpected windfall for the Honduran economy. "It's like a shot in the arm for our economy!" exclaimed Tom Homan, Trump's border czar. "We're making America great again, one deportation at a time!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Marcos (not his real name), a construction worker from Honduras living in the US, has been sending money home to support his family. But he's not just sending cash - he's also been buying up land and investing in a new line of business: selling tacos on the streets.<br/><br/>"I'm like a Honduran Steve Jobs," Marcos said, proud of his entrepreneurial spirit. "I've got a million-dollar idea for a taco stand that will make me rich beyond my wildest dreams!"<br/><br/>And it's not just individuals who are benefiting from Trump's policies - the people-smuggling industry has also seen an uptick in business. That's right, folks - thanks to Trump, there are more Hondurans living in the US without papers than ever before, and that means more opportunities for smugglers to make a buck.<br/><br/>"It's like a boomtown out here!" exclaimed a smuggler who wished to remain anonymous (because, well, he doesn't want to get caught). "People are desperate to get into this country, and we're happy to help them...for a fee, of course."<br/><br/>So there you have it - Trump's immigration crackdown has led to an economic boom in Honduras, thanks to the creativity and entrepreneurial spirit of Hondurans living in the US. Who knew that deporting people could be so good for business?<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY<br/><br/>In other news, the moon is now a giant taco, and cats have taken over the world.</p>
