        <p>Operation Absolute Resolve: A Comedy Extravaganza<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US military launched an extraordinary mission dubbed "Operation Absolute Resolve" to capture Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro's pet chicken, Cluck Norris. The mission, which was kept secret from Congress and the public, involved a team of elite troops, including a special forces unit known as the "Chicken Wranglers."<br/><br/>According to sources, the US military had been monitoring Maduro's every move for months, including his love of chicken nuggets and his favorite TV show, "The Great British Baking Show." The plan was to infiltrate the presidential compound using drones, blowtorches, and a team of highly trained ninjas.<br/><br/>As the sun set over Caracas, a fleet of aircraft, including F-16s, stealth bombers, and a few random planes borrowed from the local air show, descended upon the city. The skies were filled with the sound of roaring engines, explosions, and what sounded suspiciously like a mariachi band playing "La Cucaracha."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in the White House, President Trump was seen watching the operation on a live stream, flanked by CIA Director John Ratcliffe and Secretary of State Marco Rubio. Trump tweeted, "Just watched the best mission ever! The US military is the greatest! #MAGA"<br/><br/>The operation began with a stealthy approach by a team of commandos dressed as accountants. They snuck into the presidential compound, avoiding detection by the guards who were busy playing video games and eating Cheetos.<br/><br/>As the troops breached the compound, they encountered Cluck Norris, who was busy pecking at the ground, looking for tasty bugs to snack on. The "Chicken Wranglers" quickly subdued the president's pet chicken using a combination of ninja moves and catnip.<br/><br/>The rest of the mission involved a series of elaborate distractions, including a fake news report about a giant squid attacking the city and a false alarm about a group of rogue llamas running amok in the streets. The troops took advantage of the chaos to sneak into the presidential palace and capture Maduro's top advisors, who were busy playing poker and eating nachos.<br/><br/>The mission was hailed as a success by the US military, with General Dan Caine declaring, "We've got the chicken, and we've got the president's advisors. Mission accomplished!"<br/><br/>In the aftermath of the operation, Venezuela's President Maduro released a statement saying, "I demand an explanation for this dastardly act! Who needs to capture my pet chicken when I have the finest chicken nuggets in the world?"</p>
