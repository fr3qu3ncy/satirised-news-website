        <p>"TikTok Sensation Turned Deportee: Mahad Mohamud's Wild Ride in Somalia"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former Uber driver and TikTok sensation Mahad Mohamud has found himself on the wrong side of Somali law enforcement after being deported from the US. But don't worry, folks, he's still got his charm - and a few death threats to boot.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (okay, it was just Mahad himself), he was arrested by ICE agents while sipping coffee and contemplating the meaning of life in Minneapolis. Next thing you know, he's being tossed into a van and shipped off to Kandiyohi County Jail Prison in Willmar, Minnesota - where, we're told, the accommodations were "strictly IKEA-approved."<br/><br/>Mahad claims to have spent six months in detention, which is a long time to spend thinking about the meaning of life (or just scrolling through TikTok on your phone). Eventually, he was transferred to Arizona for a brief stint before being sent back to Minneapolis - only to be deported again. Yes, you read that right: this guy got deported TWICE!<br/><br/>On his journey to Somalia, Mahad says he had some quality time with seven other deportees and some guards in a holding area. It's unclear what exactly happened during these "quality times," but we're pretty sure it involved a lot of awkward small talk and the occasional whispered threat.<br/><br/>Now that he's back in Mogadishu, Mahad is trying to make the most of his situation - even though his life is being threatened by al-Shabab (those guys are just a bunch of party poopers). In an effort to stay safe, he's taken up residence in a heavily fortified compound guarded by a team of expert ninja accountants.<br/><br/>When asked about his plans for the future, Mahad simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least I've got my TikTok fame - right?" Little does he know, his next big gig might just involve hosting a cooking show on Somali TV, where he'll be whipping up delicious dishes with a side of machete-wielding rebels.<br/><br/>"A Message from Mahad Mohamud's Publicist (aka His Brother)<br/><br/>As the publicist for this talented young man, I'd like to remind everyone that Mahad is still available for paid appearances - as long as they're not in the US, and don't require him to actually leave his house. Don't worry, he'll just Facetime it from his heavily fortified compound.<br/><br/>"A Word from Our Sponsor (aka Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson)<br/><br/>Folks, let this be a lesson to you all: if you're ever deported from the US, just remember that you can always find fame and fortune on TikTok - or in Somalia. Either way, it's a win-win!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on Mahad Mohamud's wild ride through the world of deportees, ninja accountants, and machete-wielding rebels!</p>
