        <p>BREAKING: Belarus Releases 123 Prisoners, Including Maria Kolesnikova, in Exchange for US Deal on Potash Sanctions<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Belarus has freed 123 prisoners, including prominent opposition activist Maria Kolesnikova, after the US agreed to lift sanctions on potash, a key ingredient in fertiliser and an important export for Belarus. But here's the twist: instead of being greeted with open arms, Kolesnikova was transported to Ukraine, where she was handed over to a team of ninja warriors who were waiting to give her a round of applause.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Kolesnikova emerged from the Ukrainian border, wearing a bright pink tutu and a pair of roller skates. "It's like she just stepped out of a disco dance party," said one stunned onlooker.<br/><br/>As part of the deal, Belarus' president, Alexander Lukashenko, has agreed to release Nobel Peace Prize winner Ales Bialiatski from prison. But in a shocking move, Bialiatski was not allowed to leave Belarus with his wife and cat, who were still being held captive by Lukashenko's secret police.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the US envoy for Belarus, John Coale, has been spotted sipping on a Starbucks coffee in Vilnius, Lithuania, where he was seen celebrating the deal with a group of mariachi dancers. "It's a major victory for democracy and freedom," Coale said, while twirling his mustache.<br/><br/>But not everyone is happy about the deal. Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, the exiled Belarusian opposition leader, has been overheard grumbling to her cat about how Lukashenko only released Kolesnikova because he wanted to sell people as expensive as possible. "It's like a weird game of Monopoly," she said, shaking her head.<br/><br/>And in other news, Julia Fenner, the British national who was freed in Belarus as part of the deal, has been spotted shopping for Christmas presents at Harrods. When asked about her experience in prison, Fenner simply shrugged and said, "It's a bit like being on a spa day, really."<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* "US Lifts Sanctions on Potash, Belarus Agrees to Release Prisoners"<br/>* "Belarusian Opposition Leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya Sees Deal as 'Leverage to Make Dictators Do Something'"<br/>* "Ninja Warriors Transport Maria Kolesnikova from Ukrainian Border"<br/><br/>See also:<br/><br/>* A video of Julia Fenner shopping for Christmas presents at Harrods, while singing "Jingle Bell Rock"<br/>* A photo of John Coale sipping on a Starbucks coffee in Vilnius, Lithuania<br/>* An interview with Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, where she discusses the deal and her cat's opinions on it</p>
