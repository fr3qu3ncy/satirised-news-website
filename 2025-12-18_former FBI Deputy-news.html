        <p>BREAKING: Dan Bongino Steps Down as FBI Deputy Director, Cites Desire to Return to His Show and Spend More Time with his Feline Overlord<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Dan Bongino, the ex-podcaster-turned-FBI-deputy-director, has announced that he will be leaving his position effective January 1st. And why, you ask? Well, it's quite simple really: President Donald Trump told him to go back to his show.<br/><br/>That's right, folks! Trump, known for his keen understanding of all things, decreed that Bongino had done a great job in office and should now return to the thing he loves most: podcasting. And so, with a heavy heart (and a lighter wallet, since he'll no longer be collecting that sweet, sweet FBI paycheck), Bongino has decided to hang up his badge and grab the mic.<br/><br/>"I'm thrilled to be leaving the FBI and returning to my true calling," said Bongino in a statement. "I mean, who needs to fight crime when you can fight with podcast listeners on Twitter?"<br/><br/>Bongino's tenure as deputy director was marked by controversy, including his claims that the pipe bomb investigation was an "inside job" and his sudden change of heart about Jeffrey Epstein's death (from "it was a conspiracy" to "he actually killed himself"). However, sources close to the FBI confirm that Bongino's real motivation for leaving was simply to spend more time with his feline overlord, Mr. Whiskers.<br/><br/>"It's not like he had anything better to do," said a former colleague. "I mean, have you seen his podcast? It's just him talking about himself for hours on end."<br/><br/>As Bongino departs, the FBI is left scrambling to find a new deputy director who can fill his oversized ego and questionable decision-making skills.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has issued a statement praising Bongino's service and wishing him well in his future endeavors. "Dan did a great job at the FBI," said Trump. "And now he'll do an even greater job on his podcast. Believe me, it's going to be yuge."<br/><br/>Update: In response to this article, Mr. Whiskers has released a statement through his publicist, saying that he is "thrilled" to have Bongino home full-time and that he promises not to scratch the furniture (much).<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* FBI Fugitive Found in Wales Can't Get Fair Trial in US, Court Told<br/>* Former NASCAR Driver Believed to Be Among Seven Killed in US Air Crash<br/>* Democrats Release Latest Batch of Epstein Photos as Justice Department Deadline Looms</p>
