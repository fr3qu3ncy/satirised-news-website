        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela's National Assembly President Announces Release of 1,500 Political Prisoners, But Not Before Causing a Scene<br/><br/>In a bizarre press conference that quickly turned into a circus, Venezuelan National Assembly President Jorge Rodríguez announced the release of 1,557 political prisoners under a new amnesty law. However, things took a turn for the absurd when Rodríguez's brother, Interim President Delcy Rodríguez, burst into the room dressed as El Chapo and started doing the cha cha slide.<br/><br/>"It's a goodwill gesture, folks!" Rodríguez exclaimed, trying to regain control of the situation. "We're releasing these prisoners because we love them...and also because we heard it was going to be a nice day outside."<br/><br/>The press conference quickly devolved into chaos as reporters began asking questions about the amnesty law and its apparent exclusion of certain prisoners, including Maria Corina Machado, who won last year's Nobel Peace Prize. Rodríguez responded by pulling out a whoopee cushion and sitting on it, causing the entire room to erupt in laughter.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, outside the press conference hall, a group of protesters held signs that read "Free Our Relatives!" and "We Want to See Some Action!" One protestor, dressed as a giant chicken, began doing the Macarena and started a conga line with the other demonstrators.<br/><br/>As for the prisoners themselves, they were reportedly being released from Zona Seven of El Helicoide prison, where conditions are notoriously harsh. "We're letting them out because we heard the food there is terrible," Rodríguez quipped. "And let's be real, folks, who needs a nice prison when you can have a free Netflix account and a comfy couch?"<br/><br/>US President Donald Trump, who has been applying pressure on Venezuela to release its political prisoners, released a statement saying he was "thrilled" by the developments but also expressed concerns that not enough was being done. "I mean, 1,500 is nice, but what about the other 9,999?" he tweeted.<br/><br/>In related news, the US military announced it had boarded another tanker ship in the Indian Ocean, this time with a cargo hold full of Justin Bieber merchandise. When asked for comment, Rodríguez simply shrugged and said "Hey, someone's gotta keep the economy going, right?"<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Venezuelan government has since released a statement saying that El Chapo is not actually Delcy Rodríguez in disguise, but rather a highly trained government agent tasked with distracting reporters during press conferences.</p>
