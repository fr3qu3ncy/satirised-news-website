        <p>BREAKING: Family Feud Goes Nuclear, Rupert Murdoch Declares Himself King of the World (Again)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Rupert Murdoch has managed to pull off what can only be described as a media coup d'etat. The 94-year-old media mogul, known for his cunning and ability to make everyone else look like fools, has successfully cut ties with not one, but three of his children: Elisabeth, James, and Prudence.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the family (aka, anyone who's been paying attention), Rupert decided that he was the only one truly fit to rule the Murdoch Empire. And by "rule," we mean he got to keep all the power, money, and control while his kids were left with nothing but a bunch of useless shares they can't even sell.<br/><br/>"It's like he wanted to be the king of the world again," said one insider. "And by 'king,' I mean he wants to be the sole ruler of the Murdoch Empire, with Lachlan as his trusty sidekick."<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Rupert didn't just stop at kicking his kids out; no, he also made sure they'd never be able to buy shares in the company again. That's right, folks, these three were literally locked out of their own family business.<br/><br/>And what did Lachlan say about this whole thing? "Good news for investors"? Are you kidding me?! This guy's got some serious skills when it comes to spinning PR, but come on!<br/><br/>The Real Winner: Rupert Murdoch<br/><br/>Rupert, the master manipulator, has once again managed to outmaneuver his own family. And by "outmaneuver," we mean he basically bullied them into submission.<br/><br/>"Rupert's like a wolverine – small but fierce and deadly," said Claire Atkinson, author of the upcoming Rupert Murdoch biography (which is sure to be a bestseller). "He'll stop at nothing to get what he wants."<br/><br/>And what he wants, right now, is total control over the Murdoch Empire. Good luck with that, Dad!<br/><br/>The Real Loser: The Family<br/><br/>It's not just about the money; it's about family dynamics and the emotional toll this has taken on everyone involved. We mean, can you imagine having your dad cut you out of his business like a bad haircut?<br/><br/>"It's sad," said another insider. "They used to be a tight-knit family, but now they're more like... well, not even 'like' a family, really."<br/><br/>The TV Show That Predicted This<br/><br/>You know that hit show Succession? The one about the dysfunctional Murdoch-esque family and their power struggles?<br/><br/>Yeah, it turns out the writers were basically prophesying this exact scenario. And we thought it was just a TV show...<br/><br/>The Verdict: Rupert Wins (Again)<br/><br/>In conclusion, Rupert Murdoch has once again emerged victorious in his battle to control the Murdoch Empire. Lachlan is happy to be his trusty sidekick, and James, Elisabeth, and Prudence are... well, they're still figuring out how to get back on their feet after being kicked to the curb.<br/><br/>Long live King Rupert!</p>
