        <p>In a bizarre move, the Trump administration has hired Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to lead a deportation squad to remove thousands of Somalis from the US, citing "country conditions" while insiders claim it's really just because he lost a bet with Vladimir Putin.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Trump Administration Cracks Down on Somali Immigration, Brings in Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to Lead Deportation Squad<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the Trump administration has announced that it will be ending protections for thousands of Somalis living in the US, making them eligible for deportation. But that's not all - they've also brought in none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson to lead the deportation squad.<br/><br/>According to sources, The Rock will be using his signature moves, including the People's Elbow and a electrifying stare-down, to convince Somalis to leave the country voluntarily. "I'm not here to deport people," said The Rock in an interview with the BBC. "I'm here to help people realize that their time in America has come to an end."<br/><br/>The Trump administration cited "country conditions" in Somalia as the reason for ending TPS, but sources close to the President claim it's actually because he lost a bet with Vladimir Putin over who could deport the most Somalis.<br/><br/>As the deportation squad begins its sweep of Minneapolis, residents are advised to be on the lookout for The Rock and his team of highly trained deportation officers. "If you see us coming," said The Rock, "just remember: can you smell what The Rock is cookin'? Because we're about to serve up some deportations, brother!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Somali community leaders have expressed outrage over the move, saying it's a clear case of racial profiling and targeting. "This is not just about Somalis," said Jamal Osman, a Minneapolis City Council member. "This is about Trump's continued efforts to make America great again by getting rid of people he doesn't like."<br/><br/>The Rock has promised to handle the deportations with care, but sources close to the President claim that if anyone gets in his way, they'll be forced to watch an endless loop of WWE smackdowns.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Trump administration has announced plans to bring in a team of highly trained dolphins to help round up deportees. "These are not your average dolphins," said a spokesperson for the President. "They're expertly trained to herd humans and will do whatever it takes to get them on that deportation plane."<br/><br/>Related:<br/><br/>* Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's Guide to Deportation: The Rock has released a new book, "Can You Smell What The Rock is Cookin'? (And How to Get Out of America)," which offers expert advice on how to avoid being deported.<br/>* Somali Community Leaders Protest Trump's Decision: A group of Somali community leaders held a protest in front of the White House, chanting slogans like "We want TPS!" and "Not my deportees!"<br/>* The Rock's Deportation Squad in Action: A video has surfaced showing The Rock and his team of deportation officers rounding up Somalis on the streets of Minneapolis.</p>
