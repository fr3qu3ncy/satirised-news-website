        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>ANTHONY JOSHUA HURT IN CAR CRASH, BECOMES UNLIKELY PASSANGER ON WILD GOOSE CHASE WITH DISNEY'S MICKEY MOUSE AND ELVIS PRESLEY<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left the boxing world stunned, former heavyweight champion Anthony Joshua was injured in a car crash in Nigeria. But what's even more astonishing is that he wasn't alone - Mickey Mouse and Elvis Presley were also on board, enjoying an impromptu road trip through the Nigerian countryside.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the car was speeding down the Lagos-Ibadan expressway when it suddenly veered off course and crashed into a stationary truck. Joshua, who was in the back seat, suffered minor injuries but is otherwise fine. Mickey Mouse, who was driving, got out of the car unscathed, while Elvis Presley, who was riding shotgun, started singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" at the top of his lungs.<br/><br/>The two members of Joshua's team who died in the crash were identified as Sina Ghami and Latif "Latz" Ayodele. They were not only integral parts of Joshua's "machine" but also known to be secretly training for a future dance-off with the Backstreet Boys.<br/><br/>As news of the crash spread, tributes poured in from around the world. "I'm devastated by the loss of Sina and Latz," said Joshua, his voice shaking with emotion. "They were not just my friends and teammates - they were also my partners in crime for our infamous 'Boxing and Baked Beans' podcast."<br/><br/>The investigation into the crash is ongoing, but sources close to the matter say that it was likely caused by a combination of factors, including excessive speed, faulty brakes, and Mickey Mouse's notorious lack of directional skills.<br/><br/>In related news, Anthony Joshua has announced plans to retire from boxing and pursue a career in professional wrestling. His first match will be against The Rock at WrestleMania 37.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>Elvis Presley's representatives have issued a statement denying any involvement in the crash. "Elvis was just along for the ride," said a spokesperson. "He was simply trying to get away from his manager, Colonel Tom Parker, who was breathing down his neck about performing at one of those dreadful '50s revival shows."<br/><br/>Mickey Mouse has also released a statement, blaming the crash on a faulty GPS system and the lack of adequate road signs in Nigeria. "It's just not my fault," he said with a shrug.<br/><br/>And as for Anthony Joshua? Well, he's just happy to be alive and still plans to build that new indoor boxing venue in Ogun State - with a special Elvis-themed café on site, where fans can come and enjoy a plate of "Burnin' Love" BBQ ribs.</p>
