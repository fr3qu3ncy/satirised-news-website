        <p>BREAKING: Football Frenzy Helps Sisters Fight Against Forced Marriage... And Also Zombies<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two sisters from an Indian village have been using their love of football to fight against forced marriage and also fend off a horde of marauding zombies.<br/><br/>Nisha Vaishnav, 18, and her sister Munna, 20, have become local heroes after refusing a proposal from a family looking for a wife for their son. The sisters, who were at football practice with their team (which was coincidentally wearing matching "Zombies Can't Kick Our Butts" jerseys), had no intention of getting married... or so they thought.<br/><br/>That's when things got weird. A group of zombies appeared out of nowhere and started trying to kick the ball away from Nisha and Munna. The sisters, being quick on their feet (and having recently practiced some fancy footwork moves with their coach, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson), managed to fend off the undead attackers using nothing but their football skills.<br/><br/>"We were like, 'Zombies can't stop us! We're going to kick our way out of this marriage proposal!' And then we did," said Munna, flashing a victory sign with her teammates in the background.<br/><br/>But it wasn't just about the zombies. The sisters' love of football has also helped them defy tradition and push back against child marriage in their village. According to sources close to the story (okay, it was Nisha's mom), their parents were initially hesitant about letting them play football... but then they saw how much fun it was.<br/><br/>"We were like, 'Okay, fine. You can play football if you wear long skirts and cover your faces,'" said Laali Vaishnav, the sisters' mom. "But no, Nisha and Munna had to go and get their hair cut short and wear sports bras and... well, that just made things worse."<br/><br/>Nisha's response? "Sorry, Mom. I'm too busy being a football star to worry about getting married young. And besides, I've got a date with a certain Dwayne 'The Rock' Johnson who wants to teach me some new moves on the pitch!"<br/><br/>As for the zombies... well, they're still out there, but Nisha and Munna have formed an alliance with a secret society of zombie-fighting football players (led by none other than David Beckham).<br/><br/>"We're like, 'Zombies are no match for us! We'll kick them back to the grave where they belong!' And then we do," said Munna, grinning from ear to ear.<br/><br/>Side note: If you ever find yourself in Padampura, Rajasthan, and happen upon a group of zombies trying to take over the local football pitch... just remember: call Nisha and Munna, and they'll be there in a flash with their trusty football skills and an arsenal of zombie-killing moves.</p>
