        <p>BREAKING: Putin Agrees Not to Attack Ukraine for a Week, but Only Because It's Too Cold Outside<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin has agreed not to attack Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, and other cities during the "extraordinary cold" weather. Yes, you read that right - Putin is putting his guns on ice because it's too chilly outside.<br/><br/>According to sources, US President Donald Trump personally called Putin and asked him to hold off on the attacks for a week. And, in a bizarre twist, Putin actually agreed! It's unclear what kind of magic Trump used to convince Putin to behave himself, but one thing is certain: the Ukrainian people are thrilled.<br/><br/>"It was like Christmas morning," said Volodymyr Zelensky, Ukraine's President. "We were all thinking it was going to be a terrible week, and then Trump called up Putin and said, 'Hey, buddy, can you please not blow anything up for a bit?' And Putin was all like, 'Okay, sure thing!'".<br/><br/>Now, we're not exactly sure what kind of sorcery is at play here, but it seems that even the most hardened Russian leaders are susceptible to the charms of a cold winter's night. Who knew?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! It turns out that Ukraine has agreed to mirror Moscow's actions - pausing its own attacks on Russian oil refineries in response. Because, you know, sharing is caring.<br/><br/>And just when we thought things couldn't get any weirder, Trump added a special request: "I asked Putin not to fire into Kyiv and the various towns for a week, and he agreed to do that. It was very nice. A lot of people said, 'Don't waste the call, you're not going to get that.' And he [Putin] did it."<br/><br/>We're not sure what kind of diplomatic ninja skills Trump has mastered, but we're just glad everyone is getting along for a week.<br/><br/>Update: Sources close to the Kremlin have confirmed that Putin's team is currently trying to figure out how to use the agreement to their advantage. In other words, they're trying to spin it so they come out looking like heroes.<br/><br/>In related news, the US Senate has blocked a government funding bill because ICE negotiations are still ongoing. But who needs a functioning government when you have Putin agreeing not to attack Ukraine? Priorities, people!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
