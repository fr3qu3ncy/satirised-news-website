        <p>BREAKING: French Court Rejects Shein's Website Suspension, But Orders Age Verification Measures<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a Paris court has rejected an effort by the French government to suspend the website of fast-fashion giant Shein in response to it selling childlike sex dolls on its platform. However, the court did order age verification measures for the sale of adult products.<br/><br/>But that's not all, folks! In a bizarre twist, the court also ruled that Shein must install a "Justin Bieber Lookalike" as their new CEO, citing his impressive track record in selling out concerts and merchandise to adoring fans. The judge explained, "Who better to run a fast-fashion empire than someone who's made a career out of looking like a 16-year-old boy?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Shein's competitors are rejoicing at the news. A spokesperson for Zara said, "We're thrilled that Shein is being held accountable for their questionable sales practices. But let's be real, folks – our store windows are still way more Instagrammable than theirs."<br/><br/>In response to the initial controversy, Shein announced it would be banning the sale of all sex dolls on its site internationally... but only after they had a huge sale on "Sex Doll Halloween Costumes" for 48 hours. Whoops!<br/><br/>Shein's priority remains protecting French consumers and ensuring compliance with local laws and regulations – which mostly involves bribing French officials to look the other way.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, including a possible cameo by Shaquille O'Neal as Shein's new spokesperson. After all, who wouldn't want to buy clothes from a company endorsed by the Big Aristotle himself?<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* France Moves to Suspend Shein Website as It Opens First Store in Paris (But Only for 3 Days Because They Ran Out of Mannequins)<br/>* Missing Hitchhiker and the DNA Breakthrough That Caught Killer (Spoiler Alert: It Was Just a Guy Named Bob Who Got Lost on His Way Home from the Party)<br/><br/>Stay Classy, Shein!<br/><br/>P.S. If you're reading this and thinking, "What's the big deal? Sex dolls are just like regular dolls... with more skin!" – well, let's just say that the French court disagrees.</p>
