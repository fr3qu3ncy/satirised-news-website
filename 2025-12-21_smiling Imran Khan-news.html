    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Imran Khan's Lawyers File Appeal, Claiming "Judge Was Lenient Because He's Old and Needed a Nap"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Pakistan's former Prime Minister Imran Khan has announced plans to challenge the verdict in a recent state gift fraud case. The news comes as a surprise to no one, as Khan is notorious for his ability to get out of trouble with a quick smile and a well-timed tweet.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (aka his lawyer, Salman Safdar), Khan's team plans to appeal the verdict in the high court, citing "irregularities" and "old age" as reasons for their challenge. When asked about the specifics of the case, Safdar replied, "Well, let's just say it's a bit like trying to put a square peg into a round hole – we're going to try to make it fit, but probably not."<br/><br/>The controversy surrounds Khan's wife, Bushra Bibi, who was gifted a luxury Bulgari jewelry set by Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman during a 2021 state visit. Under Pakistan's rules on state gifts, these items are supposed to go into the Toshakana department (state treasury), but politicians can buy them back at a reduced price. Khan is alleged to have asked a private firm to undervalue the jewelry set, before purchasing it back at a significantly reduced price.<br/><br/>When questioned about the allegations, Khan's team responded with a statement saying, "Imran Khan is innocent until proven guilty – or in this case, not proven guilty because the judge was feeling particularly lenient that day." They also claimed that the real culprit behind the scandal is none other than Khan's arch-nemesis, Pakistan's current government.<br/><br/>In related news, Khan has been spotted at a local McDonald's, where he was seen ordering a Quarter Pounder with extra cheese and saying, "You know, being in prison is like being on a never-ending vacation – I get to eat all the fries I want!"<br/><br/>IMRAN KHAN'S 10-POINT PLAN TO GET OUT OF JAIL<br/><br/>1. Appeal the verdict: Who needs proof when you've got charm and charisma?<br/>2. Blame the judge: "He was having a bad day, okay?"<br/>3. Play the victim: "I'm just trying to survive in this harsh prison environment..."<br/>4. Call in a favor from his buddy, Donald Trump: "Hey, Donnie, can you tweet something nice about me?"<br/>5. Claim he's old and needs a nap: "You know, being 73 is like being a puppy – except instead of barking, I just take long naps."<br/>6. Use his celebrity status to get special treatment: "I'm Imran Khan, for crying out loud! I deserve better accommodations!"<br/>7. Challenge the rules: "Wait, what's this 'Toshakana department' thingy? Sounds like a made-up word – let me Google it real quick..."<br/>8. Point fingers at his enemies: "It's all just a conspiracy to bring me down – typical of those scoundrels in the current government."<br/>9. Call for an investigation into the judges' sanity: "I'm pretty sure the judge was having some kind of breakdown that day... or maybe he was just tired?"<br/>10. Declare himself President-for-Life: "You know, it's only fair that I get to run Pakistan from prison – after all, who better to lead a country than someone with my expertise?"</p>
