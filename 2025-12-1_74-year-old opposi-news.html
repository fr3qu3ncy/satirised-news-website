        <p>**BREAKING: 74-Year-Old Opposition Firebrand Dies in Detention, Family Presented with Corpse and a Side of Fries**<br/><br/> Yaoundé, Cameroon - In a shocking turn of events, Anicet Ekane, the 74-year-old opposition firebrand, has died in detention under mysterious circumstances. And by "mysterious," I mean he was just presented with a corpse and told to take it home for dinner.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Ekane's wife was summoned to the military medical facility where her husband was being held, only to be met with a plate of cold fries and a lifeless body. "I asked for ketchup, but they said it wasn't part of the package deal," she said in an exclusive interview.<br/><br/>Ekane's lawyers claim that he was denied access to his medication and subjected to harsh treatment while in custody. However, officials at the Defense Ministry insist that Ekane died from a sudden case of "old-age-itis," which is a real thing, I'm told.<br/><br/>The opposition party has accused the government of rigging the elections to ensure Paul Biya's re-election as president, and Ekane's death has sent shockwaves across the nation. Supporters have taken to social media to express their outrage, using hashtags like #JusticeForAnicetEkane and #FriesForAll.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the government has offered its condolences to Ekane's family and promised to investigate the circumstances surrounding his death. When asked for comment, President Biya simply shrugged and said, "What's the big deal? He was old anyway."<br/><br/>**UPDATE:**<br/><br/>As news of Ekane's death spread, supporters gathered outside the opposition party headquarters in Douala to grieve. However, things took a turn when a group of protesters accidentally set fire to their own barricade, causing them to run away screaming "We meant to do that!"<br/><br/>In other news, the Cameroonian government has announced plans to launch an investigation into Ekane's death, but sources close to the investigation say it will likely be concluded with a simple sentence: "He died. End of story."<br/><br/>**SIDEBAR:**<br/><br/>Cameroon's 92-year-old president, Paul Biya, has been re-elected for his eighth term in office. When asked about Ekane's death, he simply shrugged and said, "What's the big deal? I'm still alive!"</p>
