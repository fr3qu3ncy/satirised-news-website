        <p>**"ANICET EKANE'S CORPSE WALKS INTO PARLIAMENT, DEMANDS MORE DEMOCRACY"**<br/><br/> Yaoundé, Cameroon - In a shocking turn of events, the corpse of Anicet Ekane, a 74-year-old opposition firebrand who died in detention, has been reported to have walked into Parliament and demanded more democracy.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Ekane's wife was seen carrying his lifeless body on her back, chanting slogans and waving a sign that read "More democracy now!" as they marched towards the parliamentary chamber.<br/><br/>"I couldn't believe my eyes," said one parliamentarian. "I was just about to give a speech when suddenly this...this...corpse walks in, demanding more democracy? I mean, what's next?"<br/><br/>The corpse, reportedly Ekane's, was seen arguing with the Speaker of Parliament over the allocation of democratic space for opposition parties.<br/><br/>"I'm not leaving until we get some answers," said the corpse, which seemed to have a particularly strong voice. "We demand a full investigation into Anicet Ekane's death, and more democracy for all Cameroonians!"<br/><br/>The parliamentary chamber was thrown into chaos as lawmakers scrambled to comprehend what was happening. Some were seen laughing and taking selfies with the corpse, while others looked on in shock.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Paul Biya has issued a statement saying that he is "shocked" by the development, but still confident in his government's ability to deliver democracy.<br/><br/>"We will of course investigate this...this...corpse-related incident," said Biya. "But I'm sure it's just a minor setback for our great nation."<br/><br/>The Cameroonian government has also announced plans to hold an emergency meeting with representatives from the world's major zombie unions, including the International Association of Zombies (IAZ) and the Zombie Workers Union (ZWU), to discuss the implications of Ekane's corpse on the global economy.<br/><br/>In other news, the government has denied any wrongdoing in Ekane's death, saying that he died of natural causes while being detained for his "hostility against the state".<br/><br/>"We just want to make it clear that Anicet Ekane was a fierce and passionate flame who burned brightly, but ultimately extinguished itself through his own stubbornness," said a government spokesperson.<br/><br/>When asked if this meant that Ekane's death was actually caused by his own ineptitude in navigating the complexities of Cameroonian politics, the spokesperson refused to comment.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ekane's party has demanded an investigation into his death and called for more democracy in Cameroon.<br/><br/>"We will not rest until we get some answers," said a party spokesperson. "And by answers, I mean a full apology from President Biya for his role in Anicet Ekane's untimely demise."<br/><br/>The United Nations has also issued a statement calling on the Cameroonian government to respect human rights and allow opposition parties more democratic space.<br/><br/>"We're not sure what this means for Cameroon," said a UN spokesperson. "But we're pretty sure it involves more democracy, less zombies, and possibly some cake."<br/><br/>**UPDATE**: The corpse of Anicet Ekane has been seen arguing with the President's advisors over the allocation of democratic space for opposition parties. Meanwhile, the government has announced plans to hold an emergency meeting with representatives from the world's major zombie unions.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
