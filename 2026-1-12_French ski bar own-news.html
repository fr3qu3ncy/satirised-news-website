    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>A French ski bar owner named Jacques Moretti was held in custody for 90 days after being found guilty of manslaughter by negligence and arson, largely due to his own dramatic antics, which included a suspiciously bouffant hairdo that seemed to be fueled by the fires he was accused of causing.</p>

        <p>FLIGHT RISK ALERT: Jacques Moretti Held in Custody for 90 Days<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Swiss authorities have determined that French ski bar owner Jacques Moretti is not only guilty of manslaughter by negligence and arson, but also has a flair for the dramatic. Sources close to the investigation confirm that Moretti's hair is so bouffant, it could single-handedly fuel a fire that would leave 40 people dead and 116 injured.<br/><br/>Moretti, along with his wife Jessica, was placed under criminal investigation after the devastating blaze at Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana. The couple has been cooperative with authorities, but their attempts to explain away the tragedy have only added to the chaos. In a bizarre press conference, Moretti's wife apologized for the "unthinkable tragedy" while simultaneously trying on a pair of sunglasses and striking a pose.<br/><br/>Swiss prosecutors argued that Moretti was a potential flight risk, mainly because he's a Frenchman with a penchant for wearing bright orange jumpsuits and saying things like, "Je suis innocent! Mais oui, I'm totally innocent!" The judge agreed, ruling that Moretti should be kept in custody for 90 days.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Crans-Montana Mayor Nicolas Feraud has been caught up in the mess, trying to explain why the bar hadn't undergone safety checks for five years. When asked about it, he shrugged and said, "Zut alors! We're Swiss, not superheroes!" The crowd gasped as he dramatically flapped his arms like a chicken.<br/><br/>The investigation continues, with authorities searching high and low for Moretti's hidden stash of sparklers and champagne bottles. In related news, the Swiss government has announced plans to ban sparklers in all local venues, effective immediately. When asked about it, Prime Minister Alain Berset simply said, "Mon dieu! We don't want any more fires... unless they're really cool and involve fire dancers."<br/><br/>UPDATE: Moretti's lawyer has released a statement saying that his client is planning to appeal the ruling, citing "irreparable harm" to his bouffant hairdo.</p>
