        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Miracle in the Mekong<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has announced that Thailand and Cambodia have agreed to halt fighting "effective this evening", following days of intense border clashes. But don't worry, folks, we've got all the tea on this diplomatic miracle.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was just one guy with a selfie stick), Thai PM Anutin Charnvirakul and Cambodian counterpart Hun Manet were spotted sipping Singha beer and playing a game of "I Spy" while negotiating their way out of this mess. Who knew they had so much in common?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Trump took to Truth Social (yes, that's still a thing) to declare, "Both countries are ready for PEACE and continued Trade with the United States of America." Because what's more important than trade when you're trying to broker peace between two warring nations?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Thailand, PM Charnvirakul has vowed to "cease fire, withdraw troops, and remove all landmines" – provided Cambodia agrees to meet his demands for a 100% increase in the price of sticky rice. It's unclear what kind of miracle Trump has performed here, but we're guessing it involves a very generous side of pad thai.<br/><br/>Sources close to the negotiations have revealed that the key to this breakthrough was Trump's ingenious plan to trade 10,000 cases of his famous McDonald's Big Macs for a brand-new Boeing factory in Cambodia. "It's a deal so sweet, it'll make your teeth ache," said one diplomat, who wished to remain anonymous (but probably just wanted to get out of the meeting early).<br/><br/>And let's not forget about Trump's trusty sidekick, Senator Ted Cruz – the man who brought you the magic words: "I'm for free trade!" Who knew those were the magic words to end a war? We're still trying to figure that one out.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The Mekong River has become the latest casualty of the Trump Administration's diplomatic prowess. Or maybe we just got played by some crafty Southeast Asians who know how to play hardball (and really love sticky rice).<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this unfolding saga – or should we say, unfolding debacle?</p>
