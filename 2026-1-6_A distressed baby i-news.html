        <p>BREAKING: NESTLE RECALLS BABY FORMULA DUE TO TOXIN FEARS, BUT DON'T WORRY, IT'S NOT AS BAD AS IT SOUNDS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Nestle has recalled some batches of its SMA infant formula and follow-on formula due to concerns that they contain the dreaded Cereulide toxin. But fear not, dear parents, for we have it on good authority that this toxin is about as scary as a kitten in a tutu.<br/><br/>According to experts (okay, just us), Cereulide is like the Voldemort of toxins – it's evil, but also really hard to kill with cooking or hot water. But don't worry, because it's not like it's going to turn your baby into a zombie or anything... unless you're one of those parents who lets their kid watch too much Netflix, in which case, maybe just keep an eye on them.<br/><br/>The recall is global, but Nestle assures us that the chances of anyone actually getting sick from these batches are about as likely as Elton John becoming a professional cage fighter. And if you do happen to feed your baby one of these tainted formulas, don't panic! Just call your doctor, or better yet, have your partner do it while you hide in the closet, muttering "It's not my fault!" over and over.<br/><br/>In related news, we've learned that Nestle has also recalled its Toffee Crisp bars due to a shortage of actual chocolate. So if you were planning on using those as a reward for good behavior, you're out of luck – unless you consider the phrase "I'm sorry I threw up all over your carpet" a suitable substitute for a prize.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Nestle is offering refunds to customers who return their tainted formula. But be warned: if you try to exchange it for a free KitKat bar, they'll probably just give you a stern lecture about the importance of reading labels and eating your vegetables.<br/><br/>In conclusion, while this recall may seem scary at first, it's really just a minor setback in the grand scheme of things. I mean, what's a little Cereulide between friends? Now if you'll excuse us, we have to go practice our zombie-fighting skills – just in case.</p>
