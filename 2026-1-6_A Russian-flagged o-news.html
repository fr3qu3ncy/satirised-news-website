        <p>BREAKING: US Officials Have a Warrant to Seize the Russian-Flagged Ship Accused of Breaking Sanctions... But Also Want to Steal Its Lunch<br/><br/>In a bizarre move, US officials have obtained a warrant to seize a Russian-flagged oil tanker accused of breaking sanctions. But what's even more ridiculous is that they also want to steal its lunch.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, the ship, which has been reflagged from Guyanan to Russian after changing its name to Marinera, was last spotted between Scotland and Iceland. The US officials claim that American forces plan to intercept the ship, but not before confiscating all the sandwiches on board.<br/><br/>"This is a clear case of sanctions-breaking and sandwich-snatching," said a spokesperson for the US government. "We will do everything in our power to seize this vessel and make off with its delicious snacks."<br/><br/>The situation has become even more complicated as Russia's foreign ministry has announced that it is "closely monitoring with concern" the situation around the ship, which it claims is sailing in international waters under the Russian flag.<br/><br/>In a shocking twist, Donald Trump has appeared on CNN claiming that he would be able to get US oil firms up and running in Venezuela within 18 months... if they were allowed to steal all the snacks from the Marinera first. "It's a great plan," said Trump. "We'll make Venezuela pay for our snacks, believe me."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro has taken to Twitter to express his outrage at the situation, saying that it's "an insult to our nation" and demanding an apology from the US.<br/><br/>As the standoff continues, experts are speculating about what could happen next. "This is a recipe for disaster," said Dimitris Ampatzidis, senior risk and compliance analyst at maritime intelligence firm Kpler. "We're talking about a ship with Russian flags, American officials trying to steal its lunch, and a Venezuelan president who's been accused of stealing US oil... it's a mess."<br/><br/>And in an unrelated story, the UK Ministry of Defence has announced that it will not comment on other nations' military activities... unless there are snacks involved.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Marinera has just sent out a distress signal, claiming that it has run out of snacks and is now drifting aimlessly in the North Atlantic.</p>
