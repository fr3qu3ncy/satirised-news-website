        <p>BREAKING: Trump Declares War on Venezuela's Maduro, Orders Blockade of Oil Tankers (But Not to Get the Last Donut)<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left everyone wondering what's next, US President Donald Trump has ordered a "total and complete" blockade of all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving Venezuela. Because, you know, nothing says "diplomacy" like a good ol' fashioned naval blockade.<br/><br/>The move comes just days after the US seized an oil tanker off the coast of Venezuela, which was allegedly carrying a shipment of fentanyl and other illicit substances (or so we're told). Trump's statement read: "We've got to get this oil! It's like, the best oil in the world. And Maduro is like, 'Nope, you can't have it!' So we're gonna blockade him, blockader-style!"<br/><br/>Venezuela's government was quick to respond, calling the move a "warmongering threat" and accusing Trump of trying to steal their oil resources (which, let's be real, he probably wants for his own hairpiece). Maduro himself said: "We've got more oil than you'll ever need! It's like, pouring out of our overflowing barrels... but no, you want it all? No way, José!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has been tweeting furiously about the situation, claiming that Venezuela is "completely surrounded" by a massive armada (which he says will only get bigger and better). When asked to clarify what this meant for the international community, Trump simply shrugged and said: "Don't worry about it. It's just a bunch of ships."<br/><br/>As news of the blockade spreads like wildfire, world leaders are scrambling to figure out what this means for global oil prices (hint: it won't be good). Meanwhile, Venezuela is accusing the US of trying to steal their oil resources, while Trump just wants that sweet, sweet oil.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Sources close to the White House have confirmed that the blockade will also include a ban on all Venezuelan ships carrying... wait for it... Justin Bieber's music! That's right, folks. It seems Trump has finally figured out how to get rid of J-Biebs' tunes once and for all.<br/><br/>ANALYSIS: The move by Trump is seen as a desperate attempt to distract from his own hair-related woes (see: latest selfie where he forgot to comb his mane). We spoke to an expert, who said: "This blockade is like trying to hold back the tide with a spoon. It's just not gonna work."<br/><br/>SIDE NOTE: Anyone else notice how the blockade seems to be conveniently timed for Trump's upcoming hair restoration procedures? Coincidence? Maybe.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
