        <p>BREAKING: Ana Vanessa Herrero in Caracas, Reports Hearing Loud Bangs and Planes at Unconventional Times<br/><br/>Caracas, Venezuela - In a bizarre turn of events, BBC reporter Ana Vanessa Herrero has come forward to claim that she began hearing planes at 02:00 local time. Yes, you read that right - 2 o'clock in the morning. We're not quite sure what's going on here, but we're about to find out.<br/><br/>According to Herrero, who was sipping on a thermos of coffee and watching Netflix at the time, she heard "the most deafening sounds" coming from outside her window. "It sounded like the entire Venezuelan Air Force had descended upon our humble abode," she exclaimed in an interview with our correspondent, Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>We managed to track down Herrero's neighbor, Mr. Bean, who confirmed that he was indeed having a "plane-filled night". "I mean, I've lived here for years and never heard anything like it," said the bewildered Brit. "It was as if the planes were trying to break a world record for most take-offs in one hour!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Trump has come out with a statement claiming that the United States has captured Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro. We're not entirely sure what this means, but we're pretty sure it involves a game of Risk and a bunch of miniature planes.<br/><br/>In related news, NASA astronaut Jonny Kim has just landed back on Earth after 245 days in space. Witnesses report seeing him emerge from the Soyuz capsule with a bemused expression, muttering something about "lost in space" and "where's my coffee?"<br/><br/>And, because why not? A baby seal walked into a bar in Richmond, New Zealand yesterday evening (we're pretty sure it was just a Tuesday). The marine mammal seemed particularly interested in the beer selection and politely asked if they could have a pint of Guinness. We can only assume that the bartender said something like "You want to go where no seal has gone before?".<br/><br/>As we speak, the Pope is struggling to remove a cloth covering a plaque inside an Istanbul cathedral. Witnesses report seeing him tugging at it like it's a particularly stubborn piece of fabric from the 80s. We're pretty sure he's just trying to get to the free Wi-Fi.<br/><br/>In other news, the Trump administration has announced that Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman "knew nothing" about Jamal Khashoggi's murder. Because who needs accountability when you can just blame it on someone else and have a nice cup of tea?<br/><br/>We're not sure what's more surprising - Herrero hearing planes at 2 o'clock in the morning or Trump trying to cover up yet another scandal. One thing is for sure, though: our readers are getting their money's worth with this one!</p>
