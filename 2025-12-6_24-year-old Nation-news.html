        <p>BREAKING: Andrew Wolfe, 24, Still Healing from Head Wound; Family Seeks Prayers and More Donuts<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Andrew Wolfe, the 24-year-old National Guardsman who was critically injured in an ambush-style shooting last month, is still recovering from his head wound. But don't worry, folks, he's not out of the woods yet - or should I say, out of the hospital?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the family (okay, it was West Virginia Governor Patrick Morrisey), Wolfe's head wound is "slowly healing" and he's starting to look more like himself. Which is great, because let's be honest, nobody wants a Guard member looking all swollen and bruised.<br/><br/>Wolfe's colleague, 20-year-old Sarah Beckstrom, didn't fare as well - she sadly passed away from her injuries. But hey, at least Andrew's got a second chance... and a nice hospital bed to rest his weary head in.<br/><br/>The Trump administration is taking this opportunity to remind everyone that they're still fighting the good fight against immigration and crime (yawn). And to celebrate their efforts, they've cancelled all citizenship ceremonies for immigrants from 19 countries, including Afghanistan. Because what's more American than xenophobia?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Andrew Wolfe's family is asking for prayers - not just for his recovery, but also for a steady supply of pizza and Netflix shows. We're sending them our best thoughts (and a subscription to Hulu).<br/><br/>As the investigation into the shooting continues, we can't help but wonder: what really happened that day? Was it a case of mistaken identity... or was Andrew Wolfe just trying to get out of doing his National Guard duties?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story - and in the meantime, let's all take a moment to appreciate the bravery and selflessness of our National Guardsmen. Who knows, maybe Andrew will make a full recovery and go on to become the next big thing in reality TV.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the Trump administration has added Flag Day (which is also President Trump's birthday) to their list of fee-free entry days at national parks. Because what better way to celebrate freedom than by paying nothing to visit a park?</p>
