        <p>BREAKING: Wiz Khalifa Sentenced to Nine Months in Prison for Smoking Cannabis on Stage... But There's a Catch!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, American rapper Wiz Khalifa has been sentenced to nine months in prison by a Romanian court for smoking cannabis on stage. But before you start thinking this is just another case of celebrity trouble with the law, let us tell you that things are about to get really weird.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the rapper's team (okay, it was his publicist), Wiz Khalifa was actually performing at a music festival in California when he received the news. And being the good sport that he is, he immediately dropped his mic and shouted, "Yeeeah, I'm going to Romania! Time to serve my time and get some new material for my next album... while also enjoying the country's famous donuts."<br/><br/>As it turns out, Wiz Khalifa was sentenced in absentia, which means that he won't actually have to go to prison because, well, he's already too busy touring the world with his entourage of mariachi musicians. But here's the kicker: the rapper was last seen performing with Gunna at a sold-out show in California... wearing a bright pink jumpsuit and a fedora.<br/><br/>When asked for comment on the matter, Wiz Khalifa simply shrugged and said, "Dude, I'm just trying to live my best life. If smoking a little cannabis on stage gets me some extra prison time, so be it! At least I'll have some good stories to tell when I get out."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Romanian authorities are scrambling to figure out how to extradite an American rapper who is currently on tour in Europe with a mariachi band playing traditional Mexican music. When asked for their thoughts on the matter, one government official simply shook his head and said, "Well, at least it's not like we're trying to deport a Kardashian or something... although that would be pretty wild too."<br/><br/>And so, folks, that's the latest from the world of celebrity news: Wiz Khalifa is serving time in Romania for smoking cannabis on stage, but only because he's actually just enjoying the local cuisine and getting some material for his next album. Who knew being a celebrity was all about making up crazy excuses?<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Romanian authorities have just released a statement saying that they are "very concerned" about Wiz Khalifa's sentence and are now offering him a pardon in exchange for performing at their annual Donut Festival. We're not kidding, folks!</p>
