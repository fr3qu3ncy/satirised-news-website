        <p>GREENLAND IN CRISIS: TRUMP'S DEMANDS THREATEN NATO (BUT NOT AS MUCH AS HIS COOKING)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has once again demanded that the United States take control of Greenland, citing "national security" as the reason. But what he really means is that he wants to get his hands on all the free ice cream they have there.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (and by close, we mean people who eat lunch with him), Trump's obsession with Greenland began when he heard about their legendary ice fishing tournaments. "I've got the best words," Trump said in a press conference. "And I've got the best fish sticks. But Greenland's ice cream is just... out of this world."<br/><br/>But not everyone is buying it. The people of Greenland, who are mostly indigenous Inuit and 99% of whom have never even met Trump, are like, "Uh, no thanks." Their Prime Minister, Jens Frederiksen, said in a statement that the idea of US control is a "fantasy" and that they're happy to stay as part of Denmark. Or, you know, just be left alone.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen was all like, "Uh-oh, we gotta do something about this." And so she rallied her European allies, who were all like, "Yeah, good luck with that, guys." The UK's Prime Minister, Sir Keir Starmer, even signed a statement saying "Hands off Greenland!" (which, let's be real, is just code for "Let us have the crisps instead").<br/><br/>But here's the thing: Trump isn't just after Greenland's ice cream. He also wants their minerals, like uranium and iron. You know, because he needs to build more walls. And by walls, we mean golf courses.<br/><br/>Now, Nato leaders are all like, "Uh-oh, this could get messy." Because if Trump takes over Greenland, it'll be like the beginning of a bad game of Risk. But don't worry, they've got their top diplomats working on it. Or, you know, just drinking beer and playing video games.<br/><br/>In related news, Vice-President JD Vance was spotted in Greenland last month giving a speech about how Denmark is failing to invest enough in the territory's security. We're pretty sure that was code for "We're gonna build a wall... around their ice cream shop."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story. Or not. Because let's be real, who actually cares about Greenland or its ice cream?</p>
