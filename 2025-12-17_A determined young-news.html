        <p>THE DRIVER GETS TWO PENALTY POINTS BUT MANAGES TO CLOCK THE FASTEST LAP OF THE SESSION... AND A FURIOUS BATTLE WITH A RODENT!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, F1 driver Kimi Antonelli has been involved in a heated argument with a squirrel while attempting to set the fastest lap at Daytona Milton Keynes. The 19-year-old Italian, who drives professionally for Mercedes, was seen trying to navigate the go-kart track while simultaneously evading the advances of a particularly feisty squirrel.<br/><br/>"I couldn't believe my eyes," said Daniel Prince, a witness to the incident. "Kimi was zooming around the track in his go-kart, and this tiny little rodent is running alongside him, chattering away like it's trying to negotiate a pit stop."<br/><br/>Antonelli's attempts to shake off the squirrel were unsuccessful, with the furry creature reportedly persisting in its pursuit of the F1 driver. At one point, Antonelli was seen attempting to distract the squirrel by tossing a handful of nuts in its direction, but the rodent was having none of it.<br/><br/>"It was like watching a Grand Prix showdown," said Prince. "Kimi was completely focused on setting the fastest lap, while the squirrel seemed to be determined to sabotage his efforts."<br/><br/>Despite the distraction, Antonelli managed to set the fastest lap of the session with a time of 1:25.5. However, his victory was short-lived, as he was subsequently handed two penalty points for "pushing too hard" – a move that left many onlookers scratching their heads.<br/><br/>"I mean, what's the point of giving someone a penalty for going too fast?" asked Prince. "It's not like they're trying to lose or anything!"<br/><br/>When questioned about the incident, Antonelli remained tight-lipped, only stating that he was "just really passionate about go-karting" and had no comment on the squirrel.<br/><br/>In related news, F1 fans are now calling for a new rule to be introduced, requiring all drivers to carry a designated squirrel wrangler with them at all times during racing events.</p>
