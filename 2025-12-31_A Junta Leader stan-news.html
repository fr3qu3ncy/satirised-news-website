        <p>BREAKING: Junta Leader Wins Presidential Election by Landslide, But Who Cares?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events that no one saw coming (except for everyone who did), Guinea's junta leader Gen Mamady Doumbouya has won the presidential election by a landslide. Like, seriously, it was a landslide. The man got 86.7% of the vote, which is roughly the same percentage as the number of people who were completely underwhelmed by this development.<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait, wasn't this guy supposed to be some kind of evil dictator?" And to that, I say... well, yes, he was. But hey, at least he's consistent, right? After all, when you promise not to run for office and then proceed to do just that, it's like he's saying, "I told you so."<br/><br/>According to sources (i.e., the internet), Gen Doumbouya's main rivals were barred from contesting, which is just code for "we didn't want them to win." And guess what? They didn't. I mean, who needs fair and free elections when you can just rig the system, right?<br/><br/>The Democratic Front of Guinea's flagbearer, Abdoulaye Yero Balde, came in a distant second with 6.6% of the vote. That's like getting a participation trophy, minus the participation. Meanwhile, the Liberal Bloc's Faya Lansana Millimono got a whopping 2% – which is roughly the same percentage as the number of people who actually care about this election.<br/><br/>Now, I'm not here to be some kind of election-hating party pooper (although, let's be real, that's exactly what I am). But seriously, folks, Guinea has more pressing issues than this farcical election. Like, have you seen the state of their infrastructure? It's like they took all the broken roads from a post-apocalyptic movie and put them together with some duct tape and a prayer.<br/><br/>But hey, at least Gen Doumbouya is happy. He's got his seven-year mandate, and he gets to keep on ruling Guinea with an iron fist (or, you know, a slightly-less-iron-but-still-rather-firm fist). And who knows? Maybe someday they'll get around to building some new roads. But until then, let's all just take a deep breath and pretend like this election was somehow legitimate.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, the internet has been restricted in Guinea, because of course it has. I mean, what's the point of living in a democracy if you can't even access your favorite cat videos on YouTube?</p>
