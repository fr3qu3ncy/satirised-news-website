        <p>GREENLAND ENVOY GATE: TRUMP GETS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A POLAR EXPRESS TO DENMARK<br/><br/>In a move that has left Denmark's prime minister scratching his head, Donald Trump has appointed Jeff Landry, the governor of Louisiana and a man who thinks he's a chicken nugget, as the new special envoy to Greenland.<br/><br/>The appointment was announced on Sunday, with Trump tweeting from the back seat of a Polar Express train: "Just made the greatest deal ever! I'm sending my best buddy Jeff to Greenland. He's going to make them so happy they'll be singing like Elton John at a karaoke bar."<br/><br/>But not everyone is thrilled about Landry's appointment. The prime minister of Greenland, a man named Mimi (who looks suspiciously like a cross between a platypus and a unicorn), said in a statement: "We're not interested in being annexed by the United States or anyone else for that matter. We have our own ice cream shop and we want to keep it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vladimir Putin was seen in Moscow, sipping on a flask of vodka and muttering something about "those pesky Danes" while simultaneously trying to fix his broken robot friend.<br/><br/>Back on the Polar Express, Trump and Landry were spotted having a heated debate with the conductor about who gets to control the train's horn. The conductor, a stout man with a bushy mustache, finally had to intervene, saying: "Okay, okay, let's just get back to Denmark already!"<br/><br/>GREENLAND ENVOY SPARKS FRESH ROW WITH DENMARK<br/><br/>The appointment of Jeff Landry as special envoy to Greenland has sparked fresh diplomatic row between the United States and Denmark.<br/><br/>Denmark's prime minister said in a statement that his country "must decide our own future" and that its "territorial integrity must be respected". But Trump just rolled his eyes and said: "Oh, come on, Mimi. You're not going to let a little thing like borders get in the way of a good deal, are you?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Landry was seen tweeting from the train's bathroom: "Just had the most amazing pothole experience on the Polar Express! Who needs a bathroom when you can just use a porta-potty on wheels? #LandryForPresident"<br/><br/>GREENLAND'S PRIME MINISTER HAS ISSUED A WARNING TO LANDRY<br/><br/>In a statement, Greenland's prime minister said that Landry's appointment was "a clear provocation" and that he would not be tolerated. He added: "We will not stand idly by while our sovereignty is threatened. We will fight to the last S'mores bar!"<br/><br/>GREENLAND ENVOY GETS BEHIND THE WHEEL OF A POLAR EXPRESS TO DENMARK<br/><br/>Trump has given Landry a new assignment: to drive the Polar Express train from Greenland to Denmark.<br/><br/>The train, which has been modified with a special " annexation-proof" engine, is said to be the most advanced locomotive in all of Europe. It's equipped with a state-of-the-art GPS system that will ensure it never gets lost on the way to Denmark.<br/><br/>But things took a turn for the worse when Landry got behind the wheel and started trying to parallel park the train into a tight spot near Copenhagen. The result was a spectacular crash, with the train ending up in a nearby pastry shop.<br/><br/>GREENLAND ENVOY GETS IN TROUBLE WITH THE LAW<br/><br/>Landry has been charged with reckless driving, destruction of property (the pastry shop), and making fun of Denmark's cuisine (which includes pastries).<br/><br/>The Greenland prime minister said in a statement that he was "shocked" by the news and that Landry would have to face the consequences of his actions.<br/><br/>Trump, on the other hand, just shrugged it off and said: "Hey, what's the big deal? It's just a little fender bender. We'll just bill Denmark for the damages."</p>
