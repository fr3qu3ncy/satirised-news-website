        <p>Clair Obscur Sweeps The Game Awards: A Comedy Version<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Clair Obscur: Expedition 33, a French-made role-playing game that's been flying under the radar for months, swept the Game Awards with an unprecedented nine wins. The only thing more surprising than its victory was the appearance of Elvis Presley on stage to accept the award for Best Narrative.<br/><br/>"I'd like to thank my momma, the King of Rock and Roll himself," said Elvis, sporting his iconic gold lamé suit and sunglasses, "for teaching me how to shake my hips and give a good performance. And to the team at Clair Obscur, I say 'Thank ya, thank ya very much' for making this game so darn exciting!"<br/><br/>The ceremony was hosted by Geoff Keighley, who looked like he'd just sucked on a lemon all night. "And the winner of Best Music is... Lorien Testard!" he said, before adding, "I'm sure his cat's music is also quite purr-fect."<br/><br/>Clair Obscur's director, Guillaume Broche, accepted the Game of the Year award while riding a unicycle on stage and juggling three chain saws. "This game would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of our team," he said, before taking a swig from a flask and doing a backflip off the stage.<br/><br/>Jennifer English, star of the game, accepted her Best Performance award while being serenaded by a chorus line of strippers wearing nothing but feathers and sequins. "I'd like to dedicate this award to all the neurodivergent people out there," she said, before stripping off her own costume to reveal a neon green onesie.<br/><br/>In other news, the Game Awards also announced that the new Tomb Raider game would feature a cameo by Dolly Parton as Lara Croft's grandmother. "I'm so excited to be a part of this game," said Dolly, in a statement released from her vacation home on the moon. "And I hope they don't make me do any math problems – I get tired just thinking about it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Stranger Things star David Harbour took the stage to announce that he would be starring in a new Total War: Warhammer 40K strategy game. "I'm so excited to be playing a character who's almost as powerful as my ego," said David, before launching into an impromptu monologue about the importance of Dungeons and Dragons.<br/><br/>And finally, Lenny Kravitz was on hand to announce his new role in the upcoming James Bond game 007: First Light. "I'm so thrilled to be playing a villainous character for once," he said, before adding, "Can someone please tell my publicist that I'm actually a method actor and not just doing this for the free food?"<br/><br/>In related news, the Game Awards has been renamed the "Game-O-Matic" due to its increasingly absurd and unpredictable nature. Stay tuned folks, it's going to be a wild ride!</p>
