        <p>BREAKING: Trump and Zelensky's Florida Get-Together Falls Flat<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, world leaders Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky met in Florida yesterday for what was billed as a "historic" summit. But despite the two men appearing more upbeat than usual, experts are scratching their heads wondering what exactly they achieved.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the meeting took place at Trump's Mar-a-Lago resort, which is allegedly owned by him (or so we're told). The get-together lasted a whopping 2 hours and 30 minutes, which is impressive considering it's not every day you see two grown men arguing over who gets to control Ukraine.<br/><br/>In a statement released after the meeting, Trump declared, "It was a terrific meeting! We discussed all the important stuff... like golf swings and steak tartare." Zelensky added, "I'm thrilled with the progress we made today. I think we're on the right track – as long as nobody gets hurt, that is."<br/><br/>But beneath the smiles and handshakes, experts say little has changed. The elephant in the room remains the question of Ukraine's territorial concessions to Russia, which Zelensky insists he'll never agree to (or so we're told). Meanwhile, Trump seems more interested in discussing his next golf tournament than actual conflict resolution.<br/><br/>And let's not forget about Vladimir Putin, who was noticeably absent from the meeting. Trump did mention that Putin is "serious" about peace and wants Ukraine to succeed – which raises eyebrows considering Russia's ongoing involvement in the war.<br/><br/>So, what's next? Experts predict a continued stalemate, with both leaders posturing for domestic audiences while trying not to get caught up in their own PR machines.<br/><br/>Update: As this article goes to press, sources close to Trump have revealed that he's been spotted on the phone with Putin, negotiating a deal that involves exchanging 10 Ukrainian prisoners of war for a free year's subscription to the _Trump News Network_.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this thrilling saga!<br/><br/>Sponsored by: McDonald's – because who doesn't love a good Happy Meal during a global conflict?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* Trump Meets Netanyahu in Florida; Focus Turns to Middle East Issues (3 hrs ago)<br/>* Zelensky Says Russia "Doesn't Want Peace" Ahead of Meeting Trump in Florida (2 days ago)<br/>* Rich and Voiceless: How Putin Has Kept Russia's Billionaires on Side in the War (2 days ago)<br/><br/>Recommended Viewing: <br/><br/>[video src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" poster="Donald Trump and Volodymyr Zelensky in Florida" width=480 height=360]<br/><br/>[video src="https://static.files.bbci.co.uk/bbcdotcom/web/20251210-151139-37baf2dfdd-web-2.36.1-1/grey-placeholder.png" poster="Vladimir Putin watching TV with a bunch of corgis" width=480 height=360]<br/><br/>Also on the BBC:<br/><br/>* "I Arrived from Ukraine So Tired and Frustrated" – Iryna Izotova's Story (2 days ago)<br/>* Suspect Confessed He Planted 6 Jan Pipe Bombs, Prosecutors Say (2 hrs ago)</p>
