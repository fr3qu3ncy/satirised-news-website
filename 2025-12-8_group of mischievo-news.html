    <div class="article">
        <p>Thieves Sneak into Library, Make Off with Artworks and Sausage Rolls<br/><br/>In a daring heist that would put the art world on its head, two thieves, disguised as accountants from Ernst & Young, walked into the Biblioteca Mário de Andrade in São Paulo during normal opening hours. Their target: eight engravings by French artist Matisse, which they promptly stuffed into a canvas bag along with a packet of sausage rolls and a spare set of golf clubs.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim the thieves, who were wearing matching "World's Okayest Thief" t-shirts, held up a security guard and an elderly couple who were visiting the library, demanding that they hand over their pensions and life savings. The couple, who wished to remain anonymous, claimed they gave them everything they had because they thought it was a raffle.<br/><br/>The heist, which took place on Sunday, was caught on camera by a security camera with facial recognition technology, which identified one of the thieves as Borat Sagdiyev, Kazakhstan's most famous export. Police say they are still searching for his accomplice, who is believed to be a former contestant on The Great British Baking Show.<br/><br/>"We're shocked and saddened by this brazen theft," said a spokesperson for the library. "But we're also impressed by the thieves' taste in sausage rolls – they clearly know their stuff."<br/><br/>The stolen artworks include Matisse's famous engravings, as well as at least five engravings by Brazilian painter Cândido Portinari, which were created to illustrate a special edition of the novel Menino de engheno (Plantation Boy) by José Lins do Rego. Art critics say the value of the stolen works is "incalculable," but police are estimating it to be around £10,000 – or the equivalent of 500 packets of sausage rolls.<br/><br/>The heist has left the art world reeling, with many calling for increased security measures at libraries and galleries worldwide. Others have pointed out that the thieves' choice of snack food was an interesting one, considering they were stealing artworks worth millions.<br/><br/>"This is a wake-up call for us all," said a spokesperson for the Louvre museum in Paris, which was hit by a similar heist just last month. "We need to start putting sausage rolls on display – it's clearly the new way to steal art."<br/><br/>The police are urging anyone with information about the thieves or their getaway car (which is believed to be a 1997 Ford Escort with a wonky rear bumper) to come forward. In the meantime, residents of São Paulo are being advised to keep an eye on their snack food and to carry a spare set of golf clubs at all times.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>Just hours after this article was published, police announced that they had apprehended the thieves and recovered the stolen artworks – including the packet of sausage rolls. Borat Sagdiyev is currently being held in custody, and his accomplice has been identified as a former contestant on The Great British Baking Show who is now working at a bakery in London.<br/><br/>The library has announced that it will be installing an extra layer of security measures, including but not limited to:<br/><br/>* A moat filled with sharks<br/>* A 10-foot high wall made of titanium<br/>* A team of highly trained ninja librarians<br/>* A snack bar serving only sausage rolls and other savory pastries<br/><br/>The art world is breathing a collective sigh of relief, and the thieves are facing charges of theft, extortion, and excessive snacking.</p>
