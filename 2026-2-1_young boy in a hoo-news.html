    <div class="article">
        <p>FRENCH TECH GIANT CAPGEMINI TO SELL US SUBSIDIARY THAT'S BEEN TRACING PEOPLE FOR ICE...AND THEY'RE NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT ELON MUSK<br/><br/>In a shocking move, French tech giant Capgemini has announced that it's selling its US subsidiary after the firm's work locating people for Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) sparked outrage. Yes, you read that right - ICE. The same agency responsible for deporting all the good vibes from the US.<br/><br/>It seems that Capgemini's CEO, Aiman Ezzat, had a bit of an epiphany when he found out about the contract his company signed with ICE in December 2025. "The nature and scope of this work has raised questions compared to what we typically do as a business and technology firm," he said in a statement that was roughly translated from French to English.<br/><br/>Translation: "Oops, we had no idea our subsidiary was helping ICE track down people in public places...what were they thinking?! "<br/><br/>Capgemini is now facing heat from French lawmakers who are calling for the company to be transparent about its contracts with ICE. One MP even suggested that French firms working with ICE should face sanctions - essentially saying, "Hey, you're not cool anymore."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of protesters in Minneapolis have been holding signs that read, "ICE go home" and "Capgemini, don't sell your soul (or at least your subsidiary)". It's unclear what they'll do next, but one thing's for sure - Capgemini is selling off its US subsidiary like it was a bad pair of sneakers.<br/><br/>And on a completely unrelated note, we hear that the new owners of Capgemini's US subsidiary are planning to replace all the ICE agents with accountants from Deloitte. That way, they can finally find those pesky tax loopholes everyone's been talking about!<br/><br/>UPDATE: We just got word that Liam Conejo Ramos, a 5-year-old boy detained by ICE earlier this month, has finally made it back home to Minnesota after being released. His dad was overjoyed and tweeted, "My little man is home safe and sound! Now let's go get some nachos!" <br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story...and try not to think about the impending doom that will befall Capgemini's stock prices.</p>
