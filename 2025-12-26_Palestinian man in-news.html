        <p>BREAKING: Rolling Terror Attack Unfolds in Northern Israel<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that's got everyone scratching their heads, two people were killed and several more injured when a Palestinian man from the occupied West Bank went on a "rolling terror attack" in northern Israel. Yes, you read that right - rolling terror.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the attacker, identified as 37-year-old Mohammed from Qabatiya, first ran over a pedestrian with his car while blasting Justin Bieber's greatest hits on repeat. The victim, a 68-year-old man named Mr. Katz, was left shaken but miraculously survived the ordeal.<br/><br/>Mohammed then proceeded to drive several miles away, where he stabbed an 18-year-old woman in Ein Harod. Witnesses claim she was sipping a latte and checking her phone when Mohammed suddenly appeared out of nowhere, shouting "Peace be upon you!" while wielding a knife.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad action movie," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous for fear of being called a "terrorist sympathizer." "I mean, I've seen some crazy stuff in my time, but this guy was on a whole different level."<br/><br/>The attacker's vehicle, which had been modified with a makeshift license plate reading "RAM ALLAH," was later spotted speeding away from the scene, with Mohammed shouting "This is what happens when you don't tip your Uber driver!" out the window.<br/><br/>Miraculously, Mohammed was eventually subdued by a group of brave Israeli settlers who happened to be in the area for a game night. They used nothing but their wits and a few well-placed dodgeball throws to take him down.<br/><br/>"It's always a good day when you can take down a terrorist with nothing but a few rounds of beer pong," said Yossi, one of the settlers who helped apprehend Mohammed. "We're just glad everyone is safe... except for Mr. Katz, who's still trying to get the smell of Justin Bieber out of his hair."<br/><br/>In related news, the Israeli government has announced plans to build a new settlement in Qabatiya, complete with a McDonald's and a Starbucks. When asked about the move, Defense Minister Israel Katz said, "We're just doing our part to help promote peace in the region... by building more settlements and serving overpriced coffee."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
