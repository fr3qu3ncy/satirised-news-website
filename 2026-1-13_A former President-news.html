        <p>Bill Clinton dodged a congressional subpoena regarding his association with Jeffrey Epstein, prompting Republicans to vow to hold him in contempt, all while sporting a hilariously oblivious expression on his face.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Bill Clinton Skips Epstein Testimony, Republicans Vow to Hold Him in Contempt (And He's Still Rocking That Silky Bron Patterned Shirt)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former President Bill Clinton failed to show up on Tuesday to testify before a committee investigating Jeffrey Epstein. And by "shocking," we mean completely expected from the man who still thinks it's 1995.<br/><br/>Clinton's lawyers called the subpoena "unenforceable" and claimed they'd already provided the "limited information" they had about Epstein, which is code for "we've been telling you to go away with a nice plate of cookies." Meanwhile, Clinton himself was busy lounging on Epstein's private island, sipping margaritas and reminiscing about the good old days.<br/><br/>"We communicated with President Clinton's legal team for months now, giving them opportunity after opportunity to come in, to give us a day, and they continue to delay, delay, delay," said House Oversight Committee Chairman James Comer. "I mean, I've seen more enthusiasm from a sedated sloth on valium."<br/><br/>Clinton's team responded by saying the subpoenas were "nothing more than a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals" – which is like saying a hurricane warning is just a polite way of telling you it's going to be a nice day.<br/><br/>In related news, Clinton's association with Epstein has been likened to a decades-long game of "Operation," where he carefully avoided touching any of the financier's shady friends. And by "shady friends," we mean the ones who weren't in jail or on a sex offender registry.<br/><br/>The Clintons have contended that their relationship with Epstein was purely platonic – as in, they only talked to him for hours about their shared love of tax law and crop rotation. Clinton even took four trips on Epstein's private plane, occasionally without his Secret Service detail, which is just code for "I needed some alone time with my thoughts... and Epstein's creepy smile."<br/><br/>Congress has the authority to detain someone until they comply with a subpoena, send a contempt certification to the justice department for prosecution or ask a court to force compliance – basically, it's like trying to get a cat to take a bath.<br/><br/>And speaking of cats, Clinton's lawyers have compared the subpoenas to "a ploy to attempt to embarrass political rivals" – which is about as effective as trying to scare a kitten with a vacuum cleaner.<br/><br/>Republicans are vowing to hold Clinton in contempt, and by "contempt," we mean they'll probably just write him a strongly-worded letter and hope he gets the hint.</p>
