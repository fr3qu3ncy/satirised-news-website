        <p>**BREAKING: Steve Witkoff to Hold Talks with Putin, While Putin's Cat, Mr. Whiskers, Demands Belly Rubs and a Pardon**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Steve Witkoff, the US special envoy, is set to hold talks with Russian President Vladimir Putin at the Kremlin on Tuesday. But what you may not know is that Putin's cat, Mr. Whiskers, has also issued an ultimatum: provide belly rubs and a pardon for all feline-related crimes.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Witkoff will be accompanied by none other than Donald Trump's son-in-law, Jared Kushner, who has been tasked with negotiating a deal on behalf of his father-in-law. And because what's a diplomatic meeting without a bit of reality TV flair?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky is "very optimistic" about the talks, mainly because he's heard that Putin's wife, Lyudmila, will be serving pierogies at the negotiating table, and who doesn't love a good pierogi? Zelensky also confirmed that Steve Witkoff will be meeting with UK Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, but only if Sir Keir agrees to sing "Bohemian Rhapsody" for him.<br/><br/>In related news, Russian officials claimed to have captured the strategic town of Pokrovsk in eastern Ukraine, but sources close to the Ukrainian government say it's just a bunch of old Russian guys playing hide-and-seek in their granny's garden. And as for Vovchansk, well, let's just say that Putin's cat, Mr. Whiskers, is still waiting for his belly rubs.<br/><br/>The talks come hours after Russian officials released a video of Putin visiting a command post at the weekend, where he was quoted as saying Russia had made progress in "an important area, we all understand just how important... like my cat's nap schedule." Ahead of his trip to Moscow, Witkoff also held talks with Emmanuel Macron, who promised to bring donuts for everyone.<br/><br/>The US-backed peace plan has been refined to include a clause that guarantees the release of every single person imprisoned in Ukraine for crimes such as "making too much noise," while Russia continues to push for Ukraine to cede territory in the east, which Putin's cat, Mr. Whiskers, has already claimed as his own personal scratching post.<br/><br/>White House Press Secretary Karoline Leavitt said the administration feels "very optimistic" about reaching a deal, mainly because they've been promised a free Xbox console by Putin if they agree to something. And speaking of deals, have you heard about the exclusive discount on pierogies offered by Lyudmila for all attendees at the negotiations?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, or as we like to call it: "Putin's Cat Takes Over Ukraine."</p>
