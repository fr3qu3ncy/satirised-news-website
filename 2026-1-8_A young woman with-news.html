        <h2>YOU WON'T BELIEVE What Happened to This "Pro" Tennis Player...</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>A 21-year-old Egyptian woman named Hajar Abdelkader showed up to a women's tennis tournament in Nairobi and lost 6-0, 6-0 to her first-round opponent, only later being revealed as an unqualified player who had never actually played professional tennis before.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>The Tournament That Wasn't<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the organisers of a professional women's tennis tournament have finally acknowledged what everyone else knew all along: Hajar Abdelkader shouldn't have been allowed to play. I mean, it's not like she was going to win or anything (Spoiler alert: she didn't).<br/><br/>Abdelkader, a 21-year-old Egyptian "tennis player" (air quotes intended), lost 6-0 6-0 to Lorena Schaedel in the first round of the International Tennis Federation (ITF) W35 tournament in Nairobi. And by "lost", I mean she didn't even manage to win a single game, let alone a set. I'm pretty sure she was just there for the free food and hospitality.<br/><br/>The Egyptian Tennis Federation had no idea who Abdelkader was or what she was doing in their tournament until it was too late. In fact, they've never even heard of her before (and still haven't). It's like she just showed up out of nowhere, wearing a pair of flip flops and a "I'm with Stupid" t-shirt.<br/><br/>Tennis Kenya, the governing body for tennis in Kenya, is taking all the blame for this debacle. They claim they gave Abdelkader a wildcard entry to maintain a balance of players and nations represented in the tournament. Yeah, because nothing says "balance" like a player who's never played a professional match before showing up out of nowhere.<br/><br/>In hindsight (and by hindsight, I mean about 5 seconds after she hit her first serve into the net), they should have never allowed her to play. But hey, at least she got some great practice in, right? And who needs actual tennis skills when you've got a cute smile and a charming personality?<br/><br/>The tournament's organisers are still trying to figure out how this happened. I mean, it's not like they had any red flags or anything (okay, maybe one: Hajar Abdelkader). But hey, at least they're taking responsibility for their mistakes now.<br/><br/>As one wise tennis expert (me) once said, "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. And when life gives you a player who can't even serve without hitting the net, give her a wildcard entry and hope nobody notices."<br/><br/>Update: Hajar Abdelkader has since been banned from all future professional tennis tournaments. Or at least that's what she claims on her Twitter profile.</p>
