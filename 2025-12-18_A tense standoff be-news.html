    <div class="article">
        <p>"South Africa Accuses US of Using Illegal Workers, But Trump Says They're Just Trying to Stop the Great Afrikaner Genocide..."<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, South Africa has accused the United States of using Kenyan nationals without work permits at a facility processing applications by white South Africans for refugee status. But wait, there's more! The US responded by accusing South Africa of "interference" in its efforts to admit white Afrikaners as refugees, while simultaneously claiming that they're being subjected to a "genocide" in the process.<br/><br/>According to sources, seven Kenyans were arrested after intelligence reports revealed that people "had recently entered South Africa on tourist visas and had illegally taken up work" at the centre. But here's the thing: those Kenyans were just trying to make ends meet by flipping burgers and serving Starbucks coffee to their new white friends.<br/><br/>The US has reduced its yearly intake of refugees from around the world from 125,000 to 7,500, but says it will prioritize Afrikaners, who are mostly descendants of Dutch and French settlers. Because, you know, that's exactly what the world needs: more entitled, Calvin Klein-wearing, kombucha-sipping Afrikaners.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, South Africa's government has rejected the claims, saying that no US officials were arrested and the operation was not at a diplomatic site. But don't worry, folks, because Trump has already tweeted about it and declared that he's "not surprised" by the whole thing. I mean, who needs facts when you've got Twitter?<br/><br/>In related news, a group of 50 white South Africans have already flown to the US on a chartered plane, because who wouldn't want to escape the thrill-a-minute adventures of living in post-apartheid South Africa? The US has promised them refugee status, because apparently, being persecuted by the government for owning land that was taken from black people without compensation isn't enough.<br/><br/>South African President Cyril Ramaphosa has tried to mend fences with the Trump administration, but it's like trying to put a Band-Aid on a festering wound. Meanwhile, Julius Malema is still singing "Shoot the Boer [Afrikaner], Shoot the farmer" and everyone's just ignoring him because, well, who needs that kind of drama in their lives?<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's another day in the world of South African-US relations, where everyone's just trying to figure out what's going on while simultaneously accusing each other of being wrong. And we're all just here for the memes.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've got word that Elon Musk has offered to fund a SpaceX mission to take Afrikaners to Mars, because why not? It's not like there's already enough chaos in the world or anything. Stay tuned, folks!</p>
