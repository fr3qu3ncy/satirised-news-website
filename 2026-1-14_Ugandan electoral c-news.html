        <p>BREAKING NEWS: UGANDA ELECTION CHIEF SAYS HE HAS HAD THREATS OVER RESULTS DECLARATION, BUT HE'S NOT WORRIED - MUCH<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the head of Uganda's electoral body, Simon Byabakama, has come out to say that he's had threats from senior state officials over declaring the winner of Thursday's election. But don't worry, folks, he's not intimidated... yet.<br/><br/>Byabakama was responding to a BBC question about a widely shared video which shows a presidential assistant saying the electoral commission would never declare opposition candidate Robert Kyagulanyi (aka Bobi Wine) as president, even if he were to win. And by "never," we mean that it's possible, but only in your wildest dreams.<br/><br/>When asked how he felt about these threats, Byabakama said, "Some people say if you don't declare so-and-so as president, you will see. I tell them that I am not in the business of donating votes." We're not sure what kind of business he's in, but it sounds like a real winner.<br/><br/>The poll chief also assured voters that only their will and the law would guide the process - which is great, unless they decide to vote for Bobi Wine. In that case, the law says that the candidate who receives more than 50% plus one of the total valid votes cast is the president of Uganda... but we all know how that's going to go.<br/><br/>Byabakama also had some choice words for those pesky threats: "You can see from my demeanor that fear is a word that does not exist in my vocabulary." We're pretty sure he's been practicing this in front of a mirror, and we applaud his dedication to not being scared - even when faced with the possibility of getting yelled at by powerful people.<br/><br/>In other news, President Yoweri Museveni, who has ruled Uganda for nearly four decades, is seeking a seventh term in office. Because, why not? It's not like he's getting any younger or anything. And Bobi Wine, the 43-year-old pop star turned politician, is still trying to unseat him... but we're sure that won't go well at all.<br/><br/>The internet has been cut off and mobile services limited across the country to curb "misinformation, disinformation, electoral fraud, and related risks." We're not sure what kind of risks they're talking about, but it sounds like a fun game of electoral-themed Twister.<br/><br/>All in all, it's shaping up to be an exciting election season in Uganda... or at least, as exciting as a presidential election can get when you're being threatened by the powers that be. Stay tuned for more updates!</p>
