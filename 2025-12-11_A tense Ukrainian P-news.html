        <h2>"UKRAINE IN CRISIS: Hairline More Worrisome Than War?"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky is trying to navigate a peace plan that involves a "special economic zone," control of a nuclear power plant, Nato membership, and saving his receding hairline from stress-induced thinning.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>Ukraine's President Says "Special Economic Zone" and Zelensky's Hairline Remain Unresolved Issues in Peace Plan<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky revealed that the US has proposed creating a "special economic zone" in Ukraine's frontline region. Because who doesn't love a good shopping spree during wartime? The proposal would see Ukrainian forces withdraw from parts of Donetsk, allowing Russia to advance and take control of the area.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Zelensky also revealed that the management of the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant remains a highly contentious point. It seems that the Russians are refusing to leave the premises, and Kyiv wants to share control with the Americans... or at least have them come in with a "Please note we're taking over" sign.<br/><br/>In related news, the US has also proposed that Ukraine join the Nato " Special Edition - Wartime Membership" club. Because who doesn't want to join a club that's only open during times of conflict? Zelensky was quick to point out that this would be a bad idea, mainly because the Americans don't actually want Ukraine in Nato, but rather want to use it as a bargaining chip with Russia.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has been trying to spin this all into something positive. "Hey, at least we're talking about peace now!" he exclaimed, while simultaneously sipping on a glass of vodka and checking his Instagram likes.<br/><br/>But the real star of the show is Donald Trump, who's been making headlines with his own take on the conflict. "Folks, let me tell you, this war in Ukraine is just like my wall along the Mexican border - we're going to build it, and we're going to make Russia pay for it!" he tweeted.<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the fate of Ukraine hangs in the balance. Will they be able to negotiate a peace deal? Or will they be forced to join Nato's "Special Edition - Wartime Membership" club? One thing's for sure: the world will be watching with bated breath as Zelensky tries to navigate this mess.<br/><br/>And on a completely unrelated note...<br/><br/>Zelensky also revealed that he's been having some issues with his hairline. It seems that all the stress of being president is causing it to recede at an alarming rate. "I mean, I'm not sure what's more worrying - the war or my thinning hair," he joked.<br/><br/>In response, Ukrainian officials have announced plans to create a special task force to combat the effects of stress on Zelensky's scalp. The team will be led by none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who's been hired as an advisor to help Zels handle the pressure.<br/><br/>So there you have it folks - Ukraine's president has got his priorities straight: a "special economic zone", Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant shenanigans, and a bad hair day. What more could you ask for?</p>
