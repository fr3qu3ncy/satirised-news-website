    <div class="article">
        <p>Breaking News: Businesses in Little Village Suffering Due to Immigration Raids, or as We Like to Call it, "Operation Scare-Us-Shitless"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the city's Hispanic neighborhood, Little Village - affectionately known as the "Mexico of the Midwest" (because who needs actual Mexico when you have a bunch of tacos in Chicago?) - is experiencing a severe case of "Raids-geddon". That's right, folks! For weeks, federal immigration agents have been swooping in like a swarm of angry bees, making off with undocumented immigrants and leaving businesses to suffer.<br/><br/>"It's like they're trying to scare us into submission," said Carlos Macias, owner of Carniceria y Taqueria Aguascalientes, a local grocery store and restaurant that's been serving up some of the best Mexican food this side of the Rio Grande. "Business has dropped half during the week, sometimes even more than that. People don't want to spend money... mainly because they're too scared to leave their houses."<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "But what about all those 'bad guys' they're trying to catch?" Well, let's just say that the Department of Homeland Security has a rather... creative definition of "criminal alien". According to court records, a whopping 600+ undocumented migrants have been arrested, but most of them were just your run-of-the-mill taco enthusiasts who happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time.<br/><br/>Exclusive Interview: Lupe Castillo, Republican Candidate for Illinois' 4th Congressional District (and self-proclaimed "Taco Tuesday" enthusiast)<br/><br/>We caught up with Lupe Castillo, a Little Village resident and Republican candidate for Illinois' 4th Congressional District, who had some... interesting things to say about the situation.<br/><br/>"I love what Trump's doing," she said with a grin. "I'm like, 'Hey, you can come in, but do it the right way!' Then you can stay here and pursue the life you want... as long as you're not trying to sneak in any of your undocumented relatives from Puerto Rico."<br/><br/>When asked about the impact on local businesses, Castillo shrugged and said, "Just don't bring any attention to yourself. I know these people in the neighborhood, they're not bad people, so why would they be afraid? They're only coming after the bad guys... or you know, just making a nice profit off of them."<br/><br/>Update: Local Businesses Suffering Due to Raids<br/><br/>In related news, local businesses are suffering due to the raids. Sales have dropped by as much as 60% at some restaurants and food vendors, while one mobile phone shop reported zero sales over a two-week period. "It's like they're trying to scare us into submission," said Alderman Michael Rodriguez. "Any detrimental impact on the business environment on 26th Street negatively impacts the region... mainly because we can't afford to pay for all those tacos ourselves."<br/><br/>Additional Photos: Aerial View of 26th Street and Little Village Archway (and some random pictures of cats)<br/><br/>Here's a birds-eye view of 26th street in Little Village, looking like something out of a bad 80s action movie.<br/><br/>And because we love animals almost as much as we love tacos, here are some additional photos of cats doing cat things:<br/><br/>* A cat lounging on a windowsill, looking rather pleased with itself.<br/>* A cat chasing a laser pointer, completely unaware of the impending doom that is Operation Scare-Us-Shitless.<br/>* A cat eating a taco (because why not?).<br/><br/>Stay vigilant, folks! And remember: if you see any federal immigration agents swooping in to arrest undocumented immigrants, just... uh... go to your nearest Taco Bell and order some burritos. Trust us on this one.</p>
