        <p>BREAKING: Tourist Niels Honkoop says "Total Chaos" erupted on the train, and Elmo was spotted sipping a piña colada in the aisle.<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities scratching their heads, a passenger described "total chaos" after two trains collided head-on near Peru's most popular tourist attraction, Machu Picchu. Niels Honkoop, 33, told the BBC he had switched seats part-way through the journey from the middle of the train to the back, before it crashed, injuring many of those sitting near the front.<br/><br/>"I was sipping a margarita and enjoying the view when suddenly, BAM! The table in front of me broke in two," said Honkoop. "Next thing I knew, Elmo from Sesame Street was walking down the aisle with a piña colada in his hand, saying 'I'm not sure what happened, but I think I left my slippers on the other train.'"<br/><br/>Shattered glass littered the floor of the carriage, and many were lying wounded in the aisle. One woman he saw was trapped "between a bench and a table," while another was trying to flag down a passing mariachi band.<br/><br/>"I tried to assist by moving luggage and handing out painkillers," said Honkoop. "By coincidence, I'd had a wisdom tooth removed recently so I had lots of painkillers on me. But then, things got weird. Suddenly, a chicken appeared out of nowhere and started pecking at the wounded passengers."<br/><br/>A train driver was killed and at least 40 others were injured in the crash, which took place at around 13:20 local time (18:20 GMT) on Tuesday.<br/><br/>UPDATE: PeruRail has released a statement saying they "deeply regret what has happened" and are offering discounts to all passengers who have experienced a train crash within the past month. Meanwhile, Elmo has been spotted sipping another piña colada in a nearby bar, saying "I'm just here for the drinks, folks."<br/><br/>The cause of the accident remains unclear, but authorities suspect it may be related to an ongoing dispute between providers of transport to Machu Picchu over who gets to charge the most per ticket.<br/><br/>PHOTO: A woman is seen crying and trying to flag down a passing mariachi band after the crash.</p>
