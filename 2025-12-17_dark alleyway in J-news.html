        <p>BREAKING: DJ Warras Shot Dead in Johannesburg, South Africa<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, popular South African radio and club DJ Warrick Stock (aka DJ Warras) was gunned down by a man with dreadlocks while walking down the street. The 40-year-old media personality was simply trying to get some exercise, but little did he know that his daily walk would become his last.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report seeing three suspects approaching DJ Warras, one of whom pulled out an AK-47 and started firing at the unsuspecting DJ. Witnesses claim that DJ Warras tried to run away, but unfortunately, his Nike Air Max 270s had other plans – they got stuck in a puddle, causing him to slip and fall.<br/><br/>"I was just walking down the street when I saw this guy with dreadlocks shooting at DJ Warras," said a shaken eyewitness. "I thought it was just a scene from 'Die Hard,' but then I realized that it was real life... and DJ Warras was not a fan of 80s action movies."<br/><br/>As the suspects fled the scene, they left behind a trail of destruction – including DJ Warras's broken glasses, a pair of Air Jordan 1s, and a forgotten bottle of water.<br/><br/>The police have launched an investigation and are urging anyone with information to come forward. In the meantime, DJs across South Africa are banding together to hold a candlelight vigil for their fallen brother – complete with a DJ booth set up in the middle of the street, blasting the sounds of the latest Afrikaans pop hits.<br/><br/>"We're shocked and saddened by this tragedy," said a spokesperson for the South African Police Service (SAPS). "Who knew that DJ Warras's love of 80s music would be his undoing?"<br/><br/>UPDATE: The SAPS has released a statement saying that they have identified one of the suspects as none other than Shaquille O'Neal, the former NBA star. When asked to comment, Shaq simply shrugged and said, "I'm just here for the free Wi-Fi."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in related news:<br/><br/>* The city of Johannesburg has announced plans to install more CCTV cameras throughout the city – specifically designed to catch any would-be suspects trying to breakdance through the streets.<br/>* Local business leaders have launched a new campaign to encourage people to "just walk" through the city – no running allowed.<br/>* And finally, DJ Warras's family has released a statement saying that they are considering suing Nike for designing shoes that got stuck in puddles.<br/><br/>THIS IS A DEVELOPING STORY – PLEASE CHECK BACK FOR UPDATES!</p>
