        <p>BREAKING NEWS: HONDURAN ELECTION RESULTS IN COMPLETE CHAOS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump-backed candidate Nasry Asfura has emerged victorious in the highly contested Honduran presidential election. However, his rival Salvador Nasralla is refusing to accept the result, citing "corrupt people" manipulating the vote count.<br/><br/>As the news spread like wildfire, the streets of Tegucigalpa erupted into chaos. Thousands of supporters of the governing Libre party took to the streets, wielding signs that read "TRUMP IS A JOKE" and "HONDURAS FOR THE HONDO-ROOFED!" Meanwhile, Asfura's fans were seen dancing in the streets with inflatable unicorns, shouting "YAAAS, NASRY FOR PRESIDENT!"<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! In a bizarre twist, Trump himself appeared on stage, wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and a hairpiece that looked suspiciously like a failed science experiment. "I told you, folks," he said with a grin, "that Nasry guy is going to be tremendous for Honduras. Believe me."<br/><br/>Asfura, meanwhile, has promised not to let Hondurans down, despite his questionable ability to do so. In a statement, he vowed to "bring back the good old days of corruption and nepotism," which seemed to delight his supporters.<br/><br/>In related news, the US Secretary of State Marco Rubio released a statement urging all parties to respect the result, while also announcing plans to establish a new fast-food chain in Honduras called "Rubio's Nachos." When asked for comment, a spokesperson for Rubio's team said, "Hey, someone's gotta feed those Hondurans. Might as well be us."<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, outgoing President Xiomara Castro has accused Trump of orchestrating an "electoral coup" and interfering with the vote count. We're not sure what's more surprising - Castro's allegations or the fact that she thinks she can out-trump Trump.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's business as usual in Honduras. Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which will likely involve more drama, more controversy, and possibly even a cameo appearance by El Chapo himself.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Salvador Nasralla has announced his candidacy for President of the World. When asked about his qualifications, he said, "Well, I'm pretty sure I can do better than Trump."</p>
