        <p>BREAKING: Israeli Hostage Reveals Secret Life in Gaza as a Disco Dancing Instructor<br/><br/>In a shocking revelation, former Israeli hostage Sasha Troufanov has come forward to reveal his secret life in Gaza as a disco dancing instructor. The 30-year-old Amazon electronics engineer was taken hostage on October 7, 2023, by Palestinian Islamic Jihad gunmen and held for nearly 500 days.<br/><br/>Troufanov, who was released in February 2025 after 498 days in captivity, told the BBC that during his time in Gaza, he not only survived on meager rations but also taught disco dancing to his captors. "It was a way of keeping my sanity," said Troufanov. "I'd put on my platform shoes and polyester jumpsuit, and we'd dance the night away under the stars."<br/><br/>Troufanov's story takes a bizarre turn when he reveals that his disco classes became so popular among his captors that they even formed a disco band called "The Gaza Groove." "They were huge fans of Bee Gees," said Troufanov. "We'd sing 'Stayin' Alive' and 'How Deep Is Your Love' all night long."<br/><br/>But what's even more astonishing is that Troufanov's fiancée, Sapir Cohen, was also a hostage during his captivity. However, she wasn't just any ordinary hostage; she was a professional snail trainer. "It was a weird thing to train for," said Cohen. "But I figured it would come in handy if we ever got out of there."<br/><br/>Despite the challenges they faced, Troufanov and Cohen managed to keep their spirits high by watching reruns of The Simpsons on a small TV set provided by their captors. "We'd laugh at Homer's antics for hours," said Troufanov.<br/><br/>The news of Troufanov's secret life in Gaza has sent shockwaves across the globe, with many wondering how such a situation could have occurred. "It just goes to show that even in the most difficult circumstances, there's always room for disco dancing and snail training," said a spokesperson for the BBC.<br/><br/>As for Troufanov and Cohen, they're now back home and planning their wedding – complete with disco music and snails as ring bearers. "We're just happy to be alive and still have our sanity intact," said Troufanov. "Who knew being held hostage could be so...enlightening?"<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Gaza Groove has announced a world tour, with dates in Israel, Palestine, and the UK. Get ready for some serious disco fever!<br/><br/>Related Story: In other news, Ran Gvili's body was returned to Israel on Monday, marking the end of all hostage situations in Gaza. However, sources close to the situation have revealed that Gvili had been secretly training a team of snails to participate in the upcoming Snail Olympics. "It's going to be a real nail-biter," said an official.</p>
