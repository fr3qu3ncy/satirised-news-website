        <p>**BREAKING: Chaos Ensues as Pastors, Brides, and Beyoncé Get Kidnapped in Nigeria**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a church was raided in central Nigeria, and a wedding party in the mostly Muslim north got hijacked by bandits. Because, why not? It's not like they have better things to do, like watching paint dry or waiting for a bus.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (aka, the pastor's aunt), the attackers stormed the newly established Cherubim and Seraphim Church on Sunday in Kogi state, firing shots and making off with the pastor, his wife, and several congregants. The bride and her bridesmaids were also kidnapped in Sokoto state, because who needs a peaceful wedding when you can have a thrilling kidnapping experience?<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad movie," said Pastor John, still shaken from the ordeal. "One minute we were singing hymns, the next minute they were pointing guns at us and screaming, 'Nobody move, we're here for the free Wi-Fi!'"<br/><br/>The attackers also made off with a baby, its mother, and another woman, because why not? It's not like they have enough to do already.<br/><br/>Analysts are still trying to figure out who is behind these kidnappings – most think it's just your run-of-the-mill criminal gangs looking for ransom payments. However, some experts believe it might be the work of jihadist groups, aka, the Muslim equivalent of a fraternity initiation prank gone wrong.<br/><br/>"This is a classic case of 'we'll kidnap you, and then we'll demand a ransom... or else!' " said Dr. Jane Smith, an expert on Nigerian kidnappings. "But honestly, who needs a ransom when you can just put the victims in a Facebook Live video and ask for donations?"<br/><br/>The attacks have raised concerns about the vulnerability of rural communities, but hey, at least they're getting some extra excitement in their lives.<br/><br/>As one villager put it, "It's like, what's next? The mailman gets kidnapped by aliens? The pizza delivery guy gets hijacked by robots? You never know with these Nigerian kidnappers!"<br/><br/>In other news, Beyoncé has been spotted in the area, looking suspiciously like a bride. When asked for comment, she simply shrugged and said, "Who run the world? Girls who get kidnapped, duh!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story. Or not.</p>
