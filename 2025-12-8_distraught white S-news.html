        <p>BREAKING: Donald Trump Declares All White South Africans Eligible for Asylum, But Ignores Black Farmers Getting Killed by "Really Mean" Thieves<br/><br/>In a shocking move, President Donald Trump has announced that all white South Africans are eligible for asylum in the US, citing "egregious actions of the Republic of South Africa". Meanwhile, black farmers like Thabo Makopo and Morgan Barrett are still getting killed by thieves who just really love to steal cows and sheep.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (okay, it's actually just a tweet from Trump), the decision was made after consulting with experts in the field of "very sad farm attacks" and "really mean thieves". When asked for comment, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, they're victims too, right? I mean, except for that one time when my buddy Vladimir Putin's cousin's dog got attacked by a raccoon."<br/><br/>Marthinus, a white farmer who has applied for asylum in the US, was overjoyed by the news. "Oh boy, oh boy! Now I can finally leave this crazy country and move to a place where the only thing I have to worry about is which diner to go to with my wife and kids!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>However, not all white South Africans are thrilled about the new policy. Morgan Barrett, a farmer who owns a 2,000-acre farm in the Free State province, was less than impressed. "I don't buy that narrative that in this area the attacks are against whites only," he said. "If they thought that the black guy had 20,000 rand sitting in his safe, they'd attack him just as quickly as they'd attack the white guy with 20,000 [rand] in the safe."<br/><br/>And what about the black farmers who are actually getting killed by thieves? Well, it seems Trump has declared them "not victims of genocide" and instead blames their lack of security measures for being targeted. "I mean, come on guys," he said. "You should really invest in some better fencing and maybe a guard dog or two. That'll show those thieves who's boss!"<br/><br/>The BBC's Africa Eye division was on the scene to document the chaos, with reporter Claire Mawisa asking Marthinus about his plans for his farm if he moves to the US. "I will give my whole life just so that my wife and my kids can be safe," he said, before adding, "But can I keep my cows? I really love those cows."<br/><br/>In related news, the US government has announced a new program to provide free donuts to all white South Africans who move to the country. When asked for comment, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, they're victims too, right?"</p>
