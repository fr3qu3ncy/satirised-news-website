        <p>THE OLYMPIC FLAME ARRIVES IN ROME AHEAD OF WINTER OLYMPICS, BRINGS BORAT AND A PASSPORT TO PARIS<br/><br/>Rome - In a shocking turn of events, the Olympic flame arrived in Rome ahead of the Winter Olympics 2026, but it wasn't alone. It brought with it the infamous Kazakhstani comedian Borat Sagdiyev, who was seen trying to photobomb the torch relay while holding a "I'm with stupid" sign.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that as soon as the flame touched down in Rome, Borat jumped out of a nearby taxi and began attempting to take selfies with the Olympic officials. When asked what he was doing, Borat allegedly replied, "I am here to show you my incredible skills at making funny faces for camera. You will be laughing so hard, your belly will ache like Russian belly dancer after drinking too much vodka."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a team of highly trained squirrels from Paris were seen attempting to steal the Olympic flame's passport. When questioned about the incident, the squirrels claimed that they needed it to get to the Olympics on time and "to impress their squirrel friends with fancy passport tricks".<br/><br/>As the Winter Olympics 2026 are just around the corner, officials are scrambling to prepare for the influx of international visitors. However, sources close to the event have revealed that the real challenge lies in keeping the Olympic flame from being possessed by a group of mischievous Italian cats.<br/><br/>"It's a tough job," said one official on condition of anonymity. "Those cats are like furry little ninjas. They can sneak up and steal the flame without anyone even noticing."<br/><br/>The Winter Olympics 2026 are set to take place in February, but with Borat and the squirrels involved, it's clear that things are about to get interesting.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THE OLYMPIC FLAME'S WILD ADVENTURES<br/><br/>[Image description: A photo of the Olympic flame being held by a person wearing a Borat costume, with a "I'm with stupid" sign in hand.
