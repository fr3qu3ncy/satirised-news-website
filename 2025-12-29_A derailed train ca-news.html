        <p>TRAIN-WRECK OF A STORY<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, a train derailed in Mexico's south-eastern Oaxaca region, leaving at least 13 people dead and almost 100 injured. But that's not even the weird part.<br/><br/>The train, which was carrying 241 passengers and nine crew members (yes, you read that right - nine!), was on its way to deliver a shipment of tacos to the Pacific port of Salina Cruz. Because what's more important than tacos?<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the train was traveling at breakneck speeds, with passengers playing bingo and drinking margaritas in the aisles. It was like a cross between a Mexican fiesta and a high-speed chase scene from The Fast and the Furious.<br/><br/>As the train rounded a bend near the town of Nizanda (which we're pretty sure is not actually a real place), it suddenly veered off course, jumped over a cliff, and landed in a nearby taco truck. Yes, you read that right - a taco truck!<br/><br/>The driver of the taco truck, who wished to remain anonymous (because, let's be real, they were probably trying to get out of serving tacos on the day), said: "I was just trying to deliver some delicious carnitas to the good people of Nizanda when suddenly this train comes flying over and lands in my kitchen! It was like a scene from a bad sci-fi movie!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Mexican President Claudia Sheinbaum (who we're pretty sure is not actually a real person either) rushed to the scene, wearing a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt and carrying a megaphone. When asked for comment, she simply shrugged and said: "Well, I guess that's just the way the taco crumbles!"<br/><br/>As rescue workers struggled to free the passengers from the wreckage, they were joined by none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who happened to be in the area filming a new movie. Because what's more Hollywood than showing up to a train wreck and saying: "Can you smell what The Rock is cooking?"<br/><br/>In related news, the Mexican government has announced plans to rename the town of Nizanda "Taco-Ville" in honor of the train wreck. And the people are rejoicing! Who needs functional infrastructure when you can have tacos?!<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which we're pretty sure will involve a lot more taco-related puns and probably some actual news too (but who knows?).</p>
