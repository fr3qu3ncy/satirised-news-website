        <p>Breaking News: Engineer Becomes First Wheelchair User to Go to Space, But Not Without a Few Hiccups<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Michaela Benthaus, a German engineer who's been confined to a wheelchair since her mountain bike accident 7 years ago, has become the world's first wheelchair user to go into space. And let me tell you, it was a wild ride.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, Blue Origin), Ms. Benthaus blasted off from Texas on Saturday with five other passengers aboard New Shepard, the reusable sub-orbital launch vehicle owned by Jeff Bezos' company. The 10-minute flight reached a point just above the so-called "boundary" of space, known as the Kármán line (yawn).<br/><br/>But here's where things get interesting: Ms. Benthaus had to navigate the capsule using a bench that extended from the hatch, which is code for "she basically climbed up into it like a boss." And let me tell you, her bravery was matched only by her questionable life choices.<br/><br/>When asked about her experience, Ms. Benthaus exclaimed, "It was the coolest experience! I didn't only like the view and the micro-gravity, but I also liked going up. That was so cool, every stage of going up." Um, okay, lady. You're basically saying that being launched into space is just a Tuesday for you.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Hans Koenigsmann, the retired SpaceX manager who helped organize the trip, was strapped in nearby to offer assistance during the flight if needed. Which means Ms. Benthaus basically had her own personal cheerleader on board, because who needs actual space training when you've got a buddy to hold your hand?<br/><br/>Blue Origin has confirmed that ground support equipment was added to help Ms. Benthaus enter and exit the capsule, which is just a fancy way of saying they had to set up a ramp for her because, well, why not? It's not like she could have just walked in there like a normal person.<br/><br/>Phil Joyce, senior vice-president of New Shepard, said that Ms. Benthaus' flight was "particularly meaningful, demonstrating that space is for everyone." And by "everyone," he means people who can afford the $200,000 ticket price and have a decent chance of not dying during the flight.<br/><br/>The cost of the mission has not been revealed, but sources close to Blue Origin have confirmed that it's still cheaper than getting a table at a hipster diner in Brooklyn. In related news, Katy Perry was spotted eating brunch at said diner yesterday, sipping on a $15 latte and wondering why she wasn't invited to the space launch.<br/><br/>And finally, in a shocking twist, it turns out Ms. Benthaus has been secretly training for this mission by playing "Space Invaders" on her phone during her daily commute. Who knew?</p>
