        <h2>UKRAINE PREPARES FOR DEFEAT BY STOCKING SNACKS, INSTALLING MOATS, AND PERFECTING PIZZA PARTY PLANS</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Russia's capture of Siversk is met with typical Ukrainian nonchalance, as the country prepares for defeat by stocking up snacks and installing moat-and-castle-style security measures.</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Russia Captures Siversk, But What's Next?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian forces have captured the embattled eastern town of Siversk, leaving Ukrainian troops to retreat with their tails between their legs. Or should we say, their beer kegs between their legs?<br/><br/>As the news broke, President Zelensky was seen sipping on a Cosmopolitan in his office, muttering something about "those darn Russians" and "my martini is getting warm." When asked for comment, he simply shrugged and said, "What's next? A nice Merlot to go with our defeat?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Ukrainian military has issued a statement saying they acted to preserve the lives of their soldiers... and their snacks. Apparently, the Russian forces had a significant advantage in manpower, but Ukraine's defense was led by a team of highly trained hamsters on treadmills.<br/><br/>The capture of Siversk brings Russia closer to the last remaining "fortress belt" cities still in Ukrainian hands – Sloviansk and Kramatorsk. These cities are now on high alert, with residents advised to stock up on supplies... and possibly install some moat-and-castle-style security measures.<br/><br/>"A Child's Death Is a Tragedy, but a Good Hair Day is a Miracle!"<br/><br/>In other news, three people – including a young child – were killed in massive overnight Russian drone and missile strikes on Ukraine. However, sources close to the scene say that one of the deceased was actually just an actor playing the role of "dead person" for a new Ukrainian film production.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the child's death was a result of an unfortunate accident involving a piñata filled with candy. As the piñata exploded, the child's parents shouted, "Oh no! Our little boy is dead!" Little did they know that their son had secretly learned how to revive himself from his acting experience.<br/><br/>"Polish Fighter Jets Were Scrambled... to Do Some Polish Dancing!"<br/><br/>As the situation in Ukraine escalated, Polish fighter jets were scrambled to respond to missiles and drones targeting western Ukraine. However, it turns out that these fighter jets were actually just a bunch of Polish guys on a lads' holiday, trying to impress their friends with some fancy flying skills.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, one of the pilots said, "Sorry, mate! We thought we were just playing a game of 'Aerobatics Top Gun'!"<br/><br/>"Energy Crisis? Who Needs Energy When You Have Pizza?"<br/><br/>With temperatures expected to drop to as low as -7C on Wednesday, Ukraine's energy operator warned of emergency power shutdowns. But sources close to the energy ministry say that the real crisis is actually a pizza shortage.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, President Zelensky said, "Don't worry about the electricity; we'll just have a pizza party instead! And if anyone complains, we can always blame it on Russia's 'deliberate' energy attacks!"<br/><br/>"And That's a Wrap... of Chaos and Destruction!"<br/><br/>In conclusion, Russia has captured Siversk, but the real question is: what's next? Will Ukraine resort to using only candles for light, or will they invent a machine that converts emotions into electricity?<br/><br/>As the situation unfolds, one thing is certain – we'll be here, bringing you the latest updates... and possibly some pizzas.</p>
