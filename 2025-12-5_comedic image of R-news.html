        <p>Russian President Vladimir Putin's visit to India was essentially just an excuse for him and Prime Minister Narendra Modi to discuss oil prices while simultaneously trying to outmaneuver the US over trade tariffs and energy security.</p>

        <p>PUTIN'S "WILD" VISIT TO INDIA: A COMEDY EXCLUSIVE<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian President Vladimir Putin paid a visit to India's Prime Minister Narendra Modi in Delhi. And by "shocking," I mean we're surprised the Indian government didn't charge him extra for the parking.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Kremlin (aka our highly-placed spies), Putin and Modi spent their time discussing some very important issues, like... (dramatic pause) ...oil! That's right, folks. Oil. The lifeblood of any nation looking to fuel its economy and also get a good tan on its citizens.<br/><br/>But it wasn't all smooth sailing for our Russian friend. You see, the United States had imposed some tariffs on India for buying Russian oil, citing "concerns" about funding the war in Ukraine (cue evil laughter). Putin, not one to be outdone by those pesky Americans, shot back with a witty remark: "Hey, if you can buy nuclear fuel from us, why can't we sell oil to you?" Ah, the old diplomatic waltz.<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking: "What about all that jazz about critical minerals and shipbuilding?" Oh, don't worry, those are just minor details. Like when your aunt asks if you want a cookie, but really she's asking if you want to invest in her timeshare business. Yeah, like that.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Putin also announced plans for Russia to build India's largest nuclear power plant – a "flagship project," no less. Because nothing says "energy security" like a nice game of cat and mouse with the US government.<br/><br/>And if all this wasn't enough, Modi decided to throw in some extra goodies, including:<br/><br/>* Two new visa schemes for Russian tourists (because who doesn't love a good tiger selfie?)<br/>* Two new consulates in Russia (just because)<br/>* And a special bonus: Russia Today will be launched in India! Because what's a trip without a healthy dose of propaganda?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks – the latest from Delhi. Putin and Modi: they're like two peas in a pod, except one pea is named Vladimir and the other is Narendra (just kidding, we think).</p>
