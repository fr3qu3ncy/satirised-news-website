        <p>BREAKING: Iranians Evicted from US, Forced to Watch Cat Videos Instead<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a chartered plane carrying more than 50 Iranians was forced to make an emergency landing in Mesa, Arizona on Sunday. But it wasn't because they were trying to escape the blistering desert heat or the in-laws' house for Thanksgiving dinner.<br/><br/>No, no. These Iranians had actually been trying to leave the United States after being deported by President Trump's team of expert racists and xenophobes. And instead of sending them back to Iran, where they would be forced to watch endless loops of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad speeches on YouTube, the US government decided to take a more... creative approach.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (okay, it was just a guy named Dave who worked in the cafeteria), Trump personally intervened and ordered the plane to divert to Cairo for an impromptu showing of cat videos on Egyptian television. "We're not deporting these Iranians," Trump tweeted. "We're just giving them a taste of what they'll be getting if they don't shape up back home."<br/><br/>The Iranians, who had been trying to escape persecution and discrimination in Iran, were stunned. "I was expecting to go back home and get yelled at by the mullahs," said one deportee. "But this? This is just cruel."<br/><br/>In response to Trump's move, thousands of people took to the streets in Tehran, waving signs that read "We're not going to watch cat videos! We're Iranians!" and chanting slogans like "Hey, hey, ho, ho! Cats gotta go!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in the US, a group of Christian converts who had also been targeted for deportation were seen huddled together in an Arizona detention center, sobbing uncontrollably. "This is just another example of Trump's war on Christianity," said Father Joseph Bach, a Franciscan priest. "We're not going to let him get away with this!"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is certain: no Iranian has ever had to endure such torture as being forced to watch cat videos on Egyptian TV.<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* Iranians Deported from US in Exchange for Cat Videos (BBC Persian)<br/>* Trump Orders Deportation of Iranians... to Cairo (Al Jazeera)<br/>* "Feline Fascism" Sparks Outrage Among Iran's LGBT Community (Pink News)</p>
