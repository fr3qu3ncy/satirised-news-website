        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Venezuelan Oil Heist Hits a Snag<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Trump's plan to unleash Venezuela's oil reserves has hit a snag. The big oil executives he met with at the White House were more interested in discussing the finer points of golf and the latest season of "The Bachelor" than committing billions of dollars to the troubled South American nation.<br/><br/>"We have had our assets seized there twice," said Exxon CEO Darren Woods, "and so you can imagine to re-enter a third time would require some pretty significant changes from what we've historically seen and what is currently the state." He added that Venezuela was currently "uninvestable," much like his cousin's garage sale on a Tuesday afternoon.<br/><br/>The meeting got off to a rocky start when Trump announced he had set aside $100 billion for Venezuelan oil, but the executives were more concerned with getting to the free donuts in the White House conference room. "I'm not sure if we can get our drilling equipment through customs," said one executive, referring to the complex rules and regulations that govern the importation of heavy machinery into Venezuela.<br/><br/>Chevron's CEO, Michael Wirth, was overheard making a bet with Trump on how many golf swings it would take for him to make a hole-in-one. "I'm thinking 17, Mr. President," he said, while Trump nodded enthusiastically and shouted "That's what I like to hear!" at the top of his lungs.<br/><br/>The executives did express some interest in investing in Venezuela, but only if they could get a guarantee that their profits would be tax-free and that no pesky Venezuelan regulators would bother them for years on end. "We're not going to invest single-digit billions of dollars," said David Goldwyn, president of the energy consultancy Goldwyn Global Strategies, "unless we can have our own private island with a 24-hour cocktail bar."<br/><br/>In related news, Trump has announced plans to build a border wall around the White House's parking lot to keep out all the pesky oil executives who keep trying to sneak in and get their hands on some of that sweet, sweet Venezuelan oil.</p>
