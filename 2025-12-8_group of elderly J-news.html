        <h2>"Robots Now Putting Socks On 1 In 3 Japanese People Who Can't Remember Where They Put Their Dentures"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Japan's elderly population crisis has reached comical levels, with a third of the population over 65 being aided by robots who can put on socks, scramble eggs, and detect early signs of dementia through analyzing walking patterns.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>Elderly People in Japan Are Getting a Little Too Old for This<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it's been reported that elderly people aged 65 and over now make up nearly 30% of Japan's population. That's right, folks, one in three Japanese people is older than your grandma - and we're not just talking about your granny who's really into anime.<br/><br/>According to sources, this has led to a crisis of epic proportions. It turns out that when old people get lost, they don't necessarily remember where they put their dentures, let alone how to find their way back home. In fact, last year, over 18,000 older folks went MIA in Japan, and some were even found dead (RIP). Police say this is a "doubling" problem since 2012 - which roughly translates to "we have no idea what's going on."<br/><br/>The Japanese government has stepped in with its trusty sidekicks: robots. That's right, folks, the future of elder care in Japan involves AIREC, a 150kg humanoid robot that can help put on socks, scramble eggs, and fold laundry - because who needs human interaction when you have robotic arms doing it for you?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Scientists at Waseda University are also working on a new technology called aiGait. This nifty tool uses AI to detect early signs of dementia by analyzing a person's walking pattern (basically, it looks for people who shuffle while walking - because that's a clear sign of cognitive decline). The goal is to intervene earlier and help old folks remain active... or at least, not shuffle too much.<br/><br/>In other news, the Japanese government has also decided to deploy an army of Poketomo robots - tiny little buddies designed to give companionship to patients living with dementia. Because who doesn't need a tiny robot friend to tell them what to do and when to take their meds?<br/><br/>The CEO of Sharp, the company behind these tiny robos, had this to say: "We're focusing on social issues... and using new technology to help solve those problems." Social issues, huh? Like where did all the human caregivers go?<br/><br/>But don't worry, Japan's got a plan. At the Restaurant of Mistaken Orders (because who needs accuracy in food orders?), patients with dementia serve food to customers while wearing little name tags with their table numbers written on them in crayon. It's like a mini-society where everyone gets served - even if it's not exactly what they ordered.<br/><br/>In conclusion, Japan is facing a dementia crisis of epic proportions. But don't worry, the country has robots on standby to help old people remember which socks go with which eggs... and that's all you need in life, really.</p>
