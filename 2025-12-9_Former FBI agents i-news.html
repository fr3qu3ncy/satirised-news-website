    <div class="article">
        <p>"Fired FBI Agents Sue Kash Patel for Being Bad at Kneeling During Protest"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, 12 former FBI agents have filed a lawsuit against their former boss, Kash Patel, alleging that they were unfairly terminated because of their participation in a protest gone wrong. The drama unfolded during the 2020 George Floyd protests in Washington D.C., where the agents made the bold move to take a knee - you know, like everyone else was doing back then.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was just one guy with a camera phone), the agents were seen taking a knee while surrounded by a "mob" of protesters. But here's the thing: they were wearing FBI jackets and everything! It's not every day that you see law enforcement blending in with the locals, am I right?<br/><br/>The agents claim that their decision to kneel was a calculated move to defuse tensions during a particularly heated protest. They even pointed out that their actions had been "reviewed" by both the FBI and the Department of Justice - yeah, because nothing says "reviewed" like a bunch of bureaucrats looking at some grainy videos.<br/><br/>But despite their best efforts, the agents somehow managed to get themselves fired by Kash Patel himself. And let's be real, folks: if you're going to fire people for taking a knee during a protest, you'd better have a pretty solid reason - like, say, they were wearing matching "I'm with Stupid" t-shirts and pointing at the crowd.<br/><br/>The ex-agents are now seeking reinstatement in their positions and back pay, because what's a little money between friends? They're also demanding that Patel be forced to take a course on "Effective Kneeling Techniques for Law Enforcement," which is just a fancy way of saying "How Not to Get Fired by Kash Patel."<br/><br/>In related news, the FBI has released a statement saying that they can't comment on the case because they're still trying to figure out how 12 agents managed to get themselves fired while wearing matching FBI jackets and taking a knee.</p>
