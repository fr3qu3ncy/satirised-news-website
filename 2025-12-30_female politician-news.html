        <p>The Country's First Female Prime Minister Governed in Periods of Violent Unrest and Economic Hardship...Sort Of<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Bangladesh's first female prime minister, Khaleda Zia, has passed away at the age of 80. But before we get to the good stuff, let's set the scene: it was the 1990s, and the economy was in shambles. People were rioting in the streets, demanding better living conditions and more ice cream trucks.<br/><br/>Enter Khaleda Zia, a feisty widow who had just taken over as prime minister after her husband, President Ziaur Rahman, was assassinated by a group of army officers while trying to get a decent cup of coffee. Yes, you read that right - coffee.<br/><br/>As the first female leader of Bangladesh, Khaleda Zia was determined to make a name for herself and bring some much-needed stability to the country. She was like a ninja, but with more sarees and less stealth. Her plan? To introduce free primary education, mandatory for all children over 5 years old... unless they were allergic to pencils.<br/><br/>Her first term as prime minister was a wild ride, with protests erupting in the streets every time she tried to make a decision. "I'm not sure what's more surprising," said one protester, "the fact that Khaleda Zia is making decisions or the fact that she's wearing a headscarf and a saree while doing it."<br/><br/>But despite the chaos, Khaleda Zia persevered. She was like a cat with nine lives - except instead of lives, she had nine corruption charges against her.<br/><br/>Her second term as prime minister was just as eventful. She formed an alliance with some Islamist parties (because who doesn't love a good Muslim-Christian-Jewish alliance?) and championed women's issues, including introducing a quota for female MPs. Because what's more fun than watching politicians bicker over parliamentary seats?<br/><br/>After her term ended in 2006, Bangladesh was gripped by riots and the country's interim government banned most political activity. Khaleda Zia was arrested on charges of extortion and corruption, because who doesn't love a good game of "Guess Who's Not Paying Their Taxes?"<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! In 2018, she was convicted and jailed for five years after being found guilty of embezzling about $252,000 intended for an orphanage trust set up when she was prime minister. Because who needs orphanages when you have corruption charges?<br/><br/>In the end, Khaleda Zia's legacy will be remembered as a testament to her unwavering dedication to public service... and her ability to stay out of jail for more than five years at a time.<br/><br/>The People React<br/><br/>* "I'm not sure what's more surprising - that she was the first female prime minister or that she lasted this long," said one Bangladeshi citizen.<br/>* "Khaleda Zia? Who?" asked another. "Oh wait, I think I remember her... nope, sorry, still haven't got a clue."<br/>* "She was like a cat with nine lives... and also like my aunt who always borrows money from me," said a third.<br/><br/>In Related News<br/><br/>* The economy of Bangladesh has continued to be in shambles.<br/>* People are still rioting in the streets demanding better living conditions and more ice cream trucks.<br/>* And Khaleda Zia's great rival, Sheikh Hasina, is still running the country with an iron fist... or at least, a slightly less-iron fist than before.<br/><br/>The End<br/><br/>Or should we say...</p>
