        <p>BREAKING: Over 2,000 People Killed in Iran Protests as Trump Promises 'Help is on its Way'<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, a US-based rights group has confirmed that over 1,850 protesters have been killed by authorities during the violent crackdown on demonstrations in Iran. And in a move that can only be described as utterly bewildering, President Trump has urged Iranians to keep protesting, promising that "help is on its way."<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better. The HRANA (Human Rights Activists News Agency) report was released while Trump was sipping tea with his good pal, Dolly Parton, at a secret underground bunker beneath the White House. Sources close to the President claim that he was "very upset" by the news, and immediately began brainstorming ideas for his next big Twitter post.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Iranian authorities have been quick to respond to the crisis, deploying an army of ninja-style commandos to take down protesters with their trusty laser-guided water pistols. The move has been hailed as a "masterstroke" by Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who was overheard saying "Those pesky protesters think they can just waltz in here and start causing chaos? Ha! We'll show them the true meaning of 'Terror-ific Thursday'!"<br/><br/>As the death toll continues to rise, experts are warning that the situation could spiral out of control at any moment. "This is a classic case of authoritarian regimes meeting their Waterloo," said Dr. Balthazar McSnazz, a leading expert on global chaos theory. "But in all seriousness, folks, it's looking like things might get really ugly around here."<br/><br/>In related news, the White House has announced that it will be hosting an emergency pizza party to discuss the situation with world leaders. Guests are invited to bring their favorite toppings and engage in a spirited round of "Guess the Number of Dead Protesters" for a chance to win a signed copy of Trump's bestselling book, "The Art of the Deal...with Iran."<br/><br/>And if you're wondering what all this has to do with Elmo, well, it turns out that the lovable Muppet has been secretly training a team of elite protest-fighting ninjas in his spare time. When asked for comment, Elmo simply replied, "Sunny day, sweepin' the clouds away...oh no, not again!"</p>
