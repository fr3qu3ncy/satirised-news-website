        <p>Thieves Use Drill to Steal €30m in German Bank Heist...and a Few Other Things<br/><br/>In a brazen heist that would put the Ocean's Eleven crew to shame, thieves used a large drill to break into a safe at a high street bank branch in western Germany and steal an estimated €30m (£26m; $35m) in cash and valuables. But that's not all they swiped - they also made off with a bunch of awkwardly-placed items, including a set of antique teapots, a vintage pinball machine, and a life-size inflatable unicorn.<br/><br/>According to police, the thieves gained access to the Sparkasse savings bank in Gelsenkirchen through an adjacent parking garage, where they used their drill to break into the safe deposit boxes. Witnesses reported seeing several men carrying large bags (which were probably just full of cash and not, say, a herd of wild monkeys) in the staircase of the garage overnight on Saturday into Sunday.<br/><br/>Police said video footage shows a black Audi RS 6 leaving the garage early on Monday morning, but they're still trying to figure out how the thieves managed to fit all that loot (and the inflatable unicorn) inside. "It's like they had a magic trunk or something," said one detective, scratching his head in confusion.<br/><br/>The bank branch was closed on Tuesday after a large number of customers gathered outside demanding information. But when police finally let them in, they were greeted by a sea of confused faces - many of the customers' safe deposit boxes had been forced open by the thieves, leaving everyone wondering what other surprises lay in store.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the perpetrators remain at large, but police are following up on several leads, including one tip that suggests they might have escaped to a nearby McDonald's, where they were last seen ordering a bunch of Big Macs and laughing maniacally. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the fast food chain said only, "Uh, no comment - we're just trying to serve our customers here."<br/><br/>As the investigation continues, police are urging anyone with information about the heist to come forward. And if you see any suspicious characters lurking around the parking garage, just remember: they might be hiding a few extra surprises in their bags...</p>
