        <p>BREAKING: Claudio Neves Valente, the Suspect in Two Shootings, Found Dead with a Satchel and Two Firearms... and a Really Bad Haircut<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the suspect in the Brown University shootings, Claudio Neves Valente, has been found dead with a satchel and two firearms. But that's not all - he also had a haircut that was so bad, it could only be described as "a crime against humanity".<br/><br/>According to police, Valente, 48, was found in a storage facility in Salem, New Hampshire, after a six-day multi-state manhunt. And let me tell you, the guy was good at hiding - he even managed to evade the authorities while wearing a pair of Crocs and a "I'm with Stupid" t-shirt.<br/><br/>But seriously, police say that Valente shot and killed two students on Saturday, 13 December, and an academic in Massachusetts two days later. And if you're thinking, "Wait, didn't this guy go to Brown University?" Well, yes, he did - back in the day when he was trying to become a physicist (Spoiler alert: it didn't work out).<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking - what about his motive? Did he have a beef with the university? Was it a revenge plot gone wrong? Nope. According to officials, Valente just decided one day that he wanted to be a mass shooter. And honestly, who hasn't had that thought at some point in their lives?<br/><br/>But in all seriousness, police are still investigating and trying to piece together the events leading up to the shootings.<br/><br/>US SUSPENDS GREEN CARD LOTTERY SCHEME AFTER BROWN SHOOTING<br/><br/>In related news, the US has suspended its green card lottery scheme after it was revealed that Valente entered the country through the program in 2017. And let me tell you, this is a huge blow to all you aspiring immigrants out there who were hoping to come to America and live the dream.<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks - President Donald Trump has assured everyone that he will make sure no more Americans are harmed by this "disastrous program". Because clearly, it's not like we have actual problems in this country that need fixing. Nope, let's just blame it all on a bunch of foreigners.<br/><br/>Brown University Student Reacts to Surviving Two Mass Shootings<br/><br/>In an exclusive interview with us, a Brown University student who survived two mass shootings had this to say: "I was like, 'Oh no, not again!' But then I realized that everyone says it'll never be me. And honestly, I'm just glad I made it out alive."<br/><br/>And if you're wondering how he managed to survive both shootings, our source revealed that he simply ducked and covered his head and muttered a few prayers. Easy peasy.<br/><br/>So there you have it - the latest update on the Brown University shootings. Stay safe out there, folks!</p>
