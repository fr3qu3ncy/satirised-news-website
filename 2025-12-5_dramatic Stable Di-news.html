        <p>Israel launched airstrikes on southern Lebanon, citing ceasefire violations, but it's really just an excuse for bombing some buildings and maybe getting revenge against the country that stole all their tea.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Israeli Military Strikes Hezbollah Sites, Citing 'Ceasefire Violation'<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Israeli military has launched a new round of air strikes on southern Lebanon, just hours after Israel and Lebanon held their first direct talks in decades. And by "direct talks," we mean two guys from each country met for 10 minutes to discuss the best way to make falafel.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, residents of the towns of Mjadel, Baraachit, Jbaa, and Mahrouna were told to evacuate areas around locations that the Israeli military alleged were weapons warehouses belonging to the Iranian-backed group Hezbollah. But don't worry, no one was hurt... except for a few chickens who got scared and flew away.<br/><br/>An Israeli military spokesman said the sites constituted a "ceasefire violation" and warned that it would continue to operate "to remove any threat" to Israel. Because nothing says "removing threats" like bombing a bunch of buildings in southern Lebanon.<br/><br/>Hezbollah, on the other hand, has yet to comment on the strikes... probably because they're too busy watching reruns of The Great British Baking Show and eating all the baklava.<br/><br/>The latest strikes and diplomatic moves coincide with a visit by a UN Security Council delegation to Lebanon to review the stalled implementation of the ceasefire. You know, because what's a war without some international pressure and awkward handshakes?<br/><br/>In other news, Pope Leo XIV has announced that he will be praying for peace at the site of the Beirut port explosion... but only if they have Wi-Fi and decent coffee.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Israel has denied any wrongdoing and claims it was just trying to "defend itself" from a group of rogue accountants who were using Hezbollah as a front to steal all the tea in Lebanon.</p>
