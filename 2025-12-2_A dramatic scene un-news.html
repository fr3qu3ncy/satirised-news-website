        <p>**Demonstrators said the plan - the country's first in euros - attempted to hide widespread government corruption, but we're not done yet!**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Bulgarian officials have announced that they are abandoning their 2026 budget plan after tens of thousands of people joined protests across the country. That's right, folks! The crowd was so big that it could've filled a stadium (but let's be real, who needs a stadium when you have a bunch of angry Bulgarians in the streets?).<br/><br/>The budget plan, which would have been Bulgaria's first delivered in euros, was met with fierce resistance from protesters who claimed it was an attempt to hide widespread government corruption. Who can blame them? I mean, we've all seen those dodgy politicians shuffling money around like they're playing some sort of shady game of financial poker.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: the government didn't just roll over and say "oh no, you got us!" No way! They decided to delay the budget plan (because who needs a deadline when you can just procrastinate?) and start fresh. Yeah, because that always works out well... said no one ever.<br/><br/>Protesters were seen setting bins on fire, breaking windows, and clashing with police in riot gear. It was like they had a PhD in chaos theory! But seriously, folks, it's not every day you see Bulgarians getting so worked up about something. Maybe it's the euros? I mean, who doesn't love the thought of having shiny new currency to spend on fancy things?<br/><br/>The country's opposition party has called for the government to resign, saying abandoning the draft budget is not enough. Yeah, because one little apology and a pat on the back usually solve all problems... said no one ever.<br/><br/>Bulgarian President Rumen Radev weighed in on the situation, calling for an end to violence and urging everyone to obey the law (because who needs personal freedom when you can just follow the rules?). He also claimed that the protests were a "provocation by the mafia," but let's be real, folks, it was probably just a bunch of Bulgarians trying to make some noise.<br/><br/>As for Prime Minister Rosen Zhelyazkov, he's still got his job (for now). But hey, at least he knows how to delay things. Who needs progress when you can just put things off till later? Am I right?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! Bulgaria's budget drama has come to an end... or so we think. After all, in the words of that great philosopher, Ferris Bueller: "Life moves pretty fast. If you don't stop and look around once in a while, you could miss it."<br/><br/>**Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story! And remember, if you're ever in Bulgaria, just join a protest or two (or three...). Who knows what kind of shenanigans you might find?</p>
