        <p>In the bizarre Spanish town of Ibi, a 200-year-old festival called Els Enfarinats devolved into utter chaos as participants hurled flour, eggs, and whipped cream at each other while dressed in military costumes and debating physics, all for charity.</p>

        <p>SPANISH TOWN GOES WACKY: "ELs Enfarinats" FESTIVAL LEAVES IBi COVERED IN FLOUR, EGGS AND SIGHs<br/><br/>In a bizarre display of festive fervor, the Spanish town of Ibi was left looking like it had been hit by a giant pastry gun after its annual food fight festival, Els Enfarinats, got underway.<br/><br/>The festival, which has been taking place for over 200 years, is a bit like a Spanish version of an April Fools' Day prank – but with more flour and egg shells. Participants don military-style costumes and stage a fake coup using eggs, flour and firecrackers, while also asking for "taxes" (donations to charity) from locals.<br/><br/>But this year's event took it up a notch. The townsfolk decided to invite the cast of "Game of Thrones" to join in on the fun, with Cersei Lannister taking on the role of the town mayor and Jamie Lannister being appointed as the head of flour distribution.<br/><br/>As the festival got underway, participants began hurling handfuls of flour at each other while shouting "You're going down, king!" – much to the delight of the crowd. But things took a turn for the weird when someone pulled out a can of whipped cream and started spraying it everywhere, causing everyone to slip and slide around like they were in a scene from a bad 80s music video.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of people dressed as Albert Einstein and Stephen Hawking began debating the physics of flour-based projectiles while dodging flying eggs. "You can't just throw eggs at someone without understanding the aerodynamics involved!" one of them shouted.<br/><br/>The festival's organizers had also set up a special "egg-throwing" zone, where participants could compete to see who could hit their target with the most eggs. But things quickly got out of hand when someone started using a giant slingshot to launch eggs at people in the crowd – causing a bunch of attendees to frantically run around shouting "Incoming! Incoming!"<br/><br/>As the day drew to a close, the town was left covered in flour and egg shells, with participants staggering around looking like they had been through a war. But despite the chaos, everyone seemed to be having a great time.<br/><br/>"It's just another day at Els Enfarinats," said one participant, covered in flour and grinning from ear to ear. "We're not just fighting each other – we're also fighting for our right to throw eggs in peace."<br/><br/>And so, the town of Ibi will continue to celebrate this strange and wonderful festival, where anything goes and the only rule is that everyone gets to have a good time.<br/><br/>IN OTHER NEWS...<br/><br/>* Pope Leo has called for an end to conflicts around the world in his Christmas message – but also mentioned that he's really looking forward to trying out that new vegan recipe for Christmas dinner.<br/>* Bridget Bardot, the legendary French actress and model, has died at the age of 91 – leaving behind a legacy of fabulous hairdos and even more fabulous outfits.<br/>* And finally, Donald Trump has appointed a special envoy to Greenland to negotiate a trade deal with Denmark – but so far, no one can seem to get in touch with him because his phone is just being used for selfies.</p>
