        <p>BREAKING: Katy Perry and Justin Trudeau Go Instagram Official with a String of Ridiculous Photographs<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, pop star Katy Perry has posted a series of hilarious photographs on Instagram that can only be described as "Instagram official" with former Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau. Yes, you read that right – the PM is now dating a pop star, and we're not even mad about it.<br/><br/>The photos, which have been making the rounds on social media, show Katy and Justin doing all sorts of ridiculous things together. In one photo, they're seen trying to eat sushi with chopsticks while simultaneously playing a game of " Simon Says" with a group of rowdy Japanese school kids. It's like they're competing in some sort of bizarre Olympic event.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! In another photo, Katy and Justin are shown attempting to do a backflip off a trampoline while wearing matching superhero capes. Because, you know, that's exactly what you want to see when you're scrolling through your Instagram feed – a 53-year-old politician and a 41-year-old pop star trying to relive their glory days.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the photo where Katy and Justin are seen having a staring contest with a giant inflatable unicorn while riding on a tandem bike through a field of sunflowers. We're not even kidding, folks – this is some Next-Level Weirdness we're talking about here.<br/><br/>But despite all the absurdity, one thing is clear: these two have got some serious chemistry going on. I mean, who else but Katy and Justin could make trying sushi with chopsticks look sexy?<br/><br/>As for what their friends and family think of their budding romance? Well, let's just say it's a mixed bag. Some people are thrilled to see the PM finally getting his groove back after all those years of boring politicians' speeches. Others are like, "Uh, isn't he supposed to be running the country or something?"<br/><br/>In any case, we're here for it – Katy and Justin's ridiculous Instagram photos have already racked up millions of likes, and we can't get enough of them.<br/><br/>So what's next for these two? Will they start a podcast where they give questionable life advice while trying to eat Cheetos? Or maybe they'll release a line of Justin-approved hair products that come with a free autographed picture of Katy Perry?<br/><br/>Whatever it is, we're sure it'll be totally Instagrammable.</p>
