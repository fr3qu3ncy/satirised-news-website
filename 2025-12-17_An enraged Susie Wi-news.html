        <p>COMEDY VERSION OF THE NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>HEADLINE: Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles Goes Off on Vanity Fair Article, Calls Donald Trump an "Alcoholic" and JD Vance a "Conspiracy Theorist"<br/><br/>In a scathing interview with Vanity Fair, Trump's Chief of Staff Susie Wiles went off on the magazine for publishing a story that she claims was "disingenuously framed" and "left out significant context." But what really got her goat was when they asked her about Donald Trump. Oh boy.<br/><br/>According to Wiles, Trump has an "alcoholic's personality" - which is weird, because he doesn't drink at all. It's like saying that a vegan has a "meat-eater's personality" just because they love the smell of bacon. She also said that Trump governs with the mindset that there's "nothing he can't do. Nothing, zero, nothing." Yeah, good luck with that, Susie.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Wiles also had some choice words for Vice President JD Vance, calling him a "conspiracy theorist" for the past decade. And by conspiracy theorist, I'm pretty sure she meant that he's just really bad at his job and likes to make up wild stories about Joe Biden's health.<br/><br/>And then there was Elon Musk, who got roasted by Wiles for being an "avowed Ketamine user" (whatever that means) who sleeps in a sleeping bag in the EOB. You know, because that's exactly what you want from your Secretary of Government Efficiency - someone who's always nodding off during meetings.<br/><br/>But the real kicker was when Wiles said that she was initially against Musk's plan to gut the USAID (which is like a government agency, but way more boring). She claimed that she thought USAID did "very good work" and that Musk's attitude of "getting it done fast" was just not helpful. Yeah, because that's exactly what you want from your Secretary of Government Efficiency - someone who's all about getting things done at the expense of doing them well.<br/><br/>And let's not forget the part where Wiles accused Vanity Fair of having a "bias of omission" by leaving out interviews with other White House staff and taking her words "wildly out of context." Oh, come on Susie, you're not fooling anyone. We all know that you just got mad because they didn't give you enough space to talk about how great Trump is.<br/><br/>In related news, Trump has tweeted that Wiles is "fantastic" and that she's been "deceived" by Vanity Fair. Because, of course he would say that. And Elon Musk? He's still sleeping in his sleeping bag over there.<br/><br/>RELATED ARTICLES:<br/><br/>* How Divides Emerged at the Heart of Trump's MAGA World (Spoiler alert: it's because they're all just a bunch of crazy people)<br/>* Elon Musk Says Doge Was "Somewhat Successful" But He Wouldn't Do It Again (Yeah, good luck with that, Elon.
