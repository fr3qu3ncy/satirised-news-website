        <p>BREAKING: Iran's Foreign Minister Tells Trump to "Shut Up, Grandma"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi has responded to Donald Trump's reckless warning that the US will intervene if peaceful protesters are killed in Iran. And let me tell you, it was EPIC.<br/><br/>Trump, who has been known to be a bit... dim-witted, tweeted: "If Iran shots [sic] and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue." Because, you know, that's exactly what we need - the US government sticking its nose into other people's business.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! Araghchi shot back: "Given President Trump's deployment of the National Guard within US borders, he of all people should know that criminal attacks on public property cannot be tolerated... and neither can his tweets." Burns!<br/><br/>And then, in a surprise move, Trump responded with an even more cringeworthy tweet: "I'm not just talking about Iran, folks. I'm talking about the entire Middle East. We're going to come in there, guns blazing, like Rambo, and save the day!" Because, you know, nothing says "diplomacy" like a 70-year-old man yelling at people on Twitter.<br/><br/>But what really took the cake was when Trump tried to justify his tweet by saying: "I'm just trying to help out, guys. Iran's got some great protesters going on, and I want to make sure they're safe." Uh-huh, sure you do, Donald. Just like how you care about the environment ( NOT! ) and want to save the polar bears ( actually, yes!).<br/><br/>And let's not forget the part where Trump claimed: "We've got the best military in the world, and we're going to come in there with a bang!" Bang? What bang? Did he mean the sound of his ego getting crushed by reality?<br/><br/>But seriously folks, this is all just a bunch of noise. Iran has its own government, and they can handle their own protests without the US swooping in like some kind of... well, like Trump.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The EU just released a statement saying: "We're concerned about the reports of deaths, but also concerned about Trump's tweets. Can someone please just put him on Twitter Jail?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this ridiculous saga!</p>
