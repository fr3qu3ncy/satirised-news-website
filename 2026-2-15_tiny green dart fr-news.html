        <p>BREAKING: Dart Frog Toxin Used to Kill Alexei Navalny, UK Says<br/><br/>In a shocking revelation that's left everyone feeling like they've been poisoned with disappointment, the UK has announced that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a dart frog toxin. Yes, you read that right – a dart frog toxin! Because what's more terrifying than a tiny green amphibian that can kill you with a single lick?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the British government (or at least, that's what they claim), the UK and its European allies have been investigating the mysterious death of Navalny for two years. And let me tell you, it was a real whodunit – until they realized it was just the Russian government being its usual shady self.<br/><br/>The toxin in question is called epibatidine, which is apparently 200 times more potent than morphine (ouch!). It's only found in tiny quantities in certain wild frogs in South America, and even then, only when those frogs are eating a specific diet. Yeah, it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack – or in this case, a frog in the Amazon.<br/><br/>Speaking of which, I'm pretty sure the frog in question is secretly working for Putin, because who needs opposition leaders when you have poison dart frogs on your side? It's like the ultimate get-out-of-jail-free card... literally.<br/><br/>Navalny's wife, Yulia Navalnaya, has been saying this all along – that her husband was poisoned by Russia. And now we know the truth: it was a tiny green amphibian with a bad attitude and an even worse haircut.<br/><br/>The Foreign Office said they've informed the Organisation on the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons about Russia's alleged breach of the Chemical Weapons Convention. Oh, great, because what the world really needed was another international scandal involving frogs and politics.<br/><br/>Russian President Vladimir Putin has yet to comment on the allegations, but I'm sure he'll have a lot to say when the time comes – like "Who, me?" or "What frog?"<br/><br/>In related news, all the world's frogs are now being kept under 24-hour surveillance by MI6, because who knows what kind of mischief they might get up to?</p>
