        <h2>YOU WON'T BELIEVE What Trump Said About Iran... and What He Was Watching on His Phone Instead</h2>

        <p>US President Donald Trump allegedly accuses Iran of waging an "unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder" targeting the US, but his seriousness about the situation is likely in question given his apparent distraction by cat videos and campaign rally expenses.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>US President Donald Trump accuses Iran of waging an "unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder targeting the United States"...or does he?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has announced that the US has started "major combat operations" in Iran. But before we get to that, let's talk about the real issue here: who's going to pay for the fireworks at Trump's next campaign rally?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (okay, it was just a tweet from Donald himself), the Iranian regime has been waging an "unending campaign of bloodshed and mass murder targeting the United States." Now, we're not sure what kind of math book the President uses, but if Iran is sending out assassins left and right, that's some serious multiplication going on. Maybe they should get a calculator?<br/><br/>But in all seriousness (just for a second), it seems like things are getting pretty hairy between the US and Iran. Just yesterday, Trump was spotted playing "Space Invaders" at the White House press corps with a bunch of interns from Twitter HQ. When asked about the escalating tensions with Iran, he just shrugged and said, "Don't worry about it, guys. I'll handle it...or maybe not." As one of our sources put it: "He's either going to start a war or get us all free Wi-Fi – probably both."<br/><br/>Now back to the "major combat operations" announcement. According to Trump's official social media network Truth Social (which we're pretty sure is just an Excel spreadsheet on his iPad), Iran has been causing quite the ruckus. But when asked for specifics, a White House spokesperson replied: "Uh... um... well... it's like that old saying goes: 'You can't make this stuff up!' (Note to self: Google the meaning of 'White House spokesperson.')"<br/><br/>Just to give you an idea of just how seriously Trump is taking this situation, we've obtained an exclusive screenshot from his phone showing him watching cat videos while simultaneously reading a briefing on Iran's nuclear program. The caption? "My experts say it's all about the cats, folks."<br/><br/>Of course, this isn't the first time Donald has gotten himself into hot water with his... let's call them "diplomatic" skills. Remember that time he accidentally tweeted, "Hey @KimJongUn! Let's grab some Kimchi at the next G20 summit"? Yeah, didn't go over too well.<br/><br/>In other news (because who cares about Iran at this point), the British government has released a statement saying they're still waiting for an invitation to Trump's next international poker game. Good luck with that one!<br/><br/>And finally, just to put everything into perspective: Donald Trump is reportedly planning to build a wall around Greenland as well – because you know what they say: "You can't have too much of a good thing... unless it's a really expensive and pointless project."</p>
