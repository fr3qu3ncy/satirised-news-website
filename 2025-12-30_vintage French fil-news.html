        <p>BREAKING: PETITION FOR BRIGITTE BARDOT TRIBUTE ATTRACTION REACHES 23,000 SIGNATURES, BUT OPPOSITION FROM LEFT WING GROWS<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, a petition launched by French right-wing politician Éric Ciotti to honour the late Brigitte Bardot with a national tribute has attracted an impressive 23,000 signatures. However, the move has been met with fierce opposition from the left wing, who claim that Bardot's far-right sympathies and incendiary remarks make her unworthy of such an honour.<br/><br/>Ciotti, leader of the right-wing UDR party, has called for a national homage to pay tribute to the film legend, citing her contributions to French cinema and her advocacy for women's rights. However, his opponents on the left have pointed out that Bardot was convicted five times for inciting racial hatred, and that her views on Muslims and other minority groups were deeply concerning.<br/><br/>"It's like trying to give a Nobel Peace Prize to Darth Vader," said Socialist leader Olivier Faure, in a scathing attack on Ciotti's proposal. "We can't just ignore the fact that she was a vocal supporter of far-right ideologies and made numerous comments that were deeply hurtful to many people."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the mayor of Nice, Christian Estrosi, has announced plans to name an iconic site in Bardot's honour, citing her enduring legacy as a French film star. However, this move has been met with ridicule from some quarters, who point out that Bardot's most notable contribution to French culture was probably her 1956 film debut in "And God Created Woman".<br/><br/>"Who needs a national tribute when you can just name a street after someone who wore less clothes than a kindergartener on their first day of school?" quipped one Twitter user. "Brigitte Bardot: where the only thing more iconic than her hair was her lack of clothing sense."<br/><br/>In related news, the Brigitte Bardot Foundation has announced plans to hold a private funeral service for the actress on January 7th, which will be broadcast live on screens across Saint-Tropez. However, sources close to the family have confirmed that Bardot herself would have wanted nothing to do with such a ceremony, and would have preferred a quiet burial in her home town.<br/><br/>"It's like trying to fit a square peg into a round hole," said one insider. "Brigitte was never one for grand gestures or public displays of emotion. She'd want it kept simple, like a plain cracker at a fancy dinner party."<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, the news has been met with excitement from the animal welfare community, who are eager to see Bardot's legacy celebrated alongside her love of animals.<br/><br/>"She was a true pioneer for animal rights," said one activist. "I mean, who else would be more likely to trade in their diamond-encrusted nose ring for a life spent rescuing stray cats?"<br/><br/>related articles<br/><br/>* Eurostar warns of ongoing delays after services resume (because who doesn't love a good train delay?)<br/>* Brigitte Bardot: from French cinema to international fame (a film about her illustrious career, or a cautionary tale about the dangers of fame?)<br/>* Cynthia Erivo's journey from Nativity play solo to MBE (a story of rags-to-riches, or just another example of the BBC's love of all things shiny?)<br/><br/>Get in touch<br/><br/>Have you got a story to share?
