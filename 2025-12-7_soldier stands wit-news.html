        <p>BREAKING: Benin Coup Attempt Foiled, President Patrice Talon Says Situation is "Totally Under Control"... Just Not for the Guy Who Forgot His Wi-Fi Password<br/><br/>Cotonou, Benin - In a shocking turn of events, a group of soldiers attempted to stage a coup in Benin yesterday, only to be thwarted by loyalist troops. But don't worry, folks, President Patrice Talon is on the case and everything is totally under control... just not for the guy who forgot his Wi-Fi password.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the soldiers stormed the national TV station, declaring a takeover and suspending the constitution. But, in a bizarre twist, they seemed to have forgotten that they needed internet to live-stream their coup attempt on social media. "We're trying to overthrow the government, but our phones are dead!" one soldier was heard saying.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Talon appeared on national TV, looking calm and collected as he reassured citizens that everything was okay. "Don't worry, folks," he said. "We've got this under control... just like I do with my Netflix password."<br/><br/>The government claims to have arrested 14 people in connection with the attempted coup, but sources close to the investigation reveal that most of them were actually just trying to get a good spot at the Christmas market.<br/><br/>Later in the day, huge explosions were heard in Cotonou, which authorities blamed on an air strike by Nigerian fighter jets. However, eyewitnesses reported seeing a group of soldiers attempting to steal a parked minivan, which they claimed was a "reconnaissance mission".<br/><br/>The situation remains unclear, but one thing is for sure: Benin's president is still in charge... and so are the Christmas tree lights on every street corner.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, it has been revealed that the soldiers who attempted the coup were actually just trying to get out of doing their holiday shopping. "We wanted to overthrow the government so we wouldn't have to buy gifts for our loved ones," said one soldier in an exclusive interview with BBC Africa. "But now that we've tried to take over, we'll probably still have to do some online shopping... ugh."<br/><br/>SIDEBAR<br/><br/>In other news, the Nigerian Air Force has announced plans to launch a new line of Christmas-themed fighter jets, complete with jingling bells and festive holly patterns.<br/><br/>"We're proud to be serving the people of Nigeria," said a spokesperson for the air force. "And we're even prouder to be serving them some holiday cheer... in the form of exploding bombs, that is."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
