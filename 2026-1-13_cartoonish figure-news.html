        <p>BREAKING: Dilbert Cartoonist Scott Adams Dies at 68, But Not Before Announcing His Own Death Live on Podcast<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Scott Adams, the infamous cartoonist behind the satirical strip Dilbert, has died at the age of 68. Or so he thought.<br/><br/>On Tuesday, during a live stream of his podcast, Real Coffee with Scott Adams, his ex-wife Shelly Miles announced to a stunned audience that her former husband was no more. But little did she know, Scott had other plans.<br/><br/>"Sorry to inform you all, but I've just been told by my wife's lawyer that I'm actually still very much alive," Scott chimed in from the dead, sporting his signature mustache and a mischievous grin. "What's more, I'm feeling better than ever! The cancer? Yeah, it was just a minor setback."<br/><br/>The newsroom was left reeling as Scott proceeded to take questions from listeners, all while wearing a "World's Okayest Cartoonist" t-shirt.<br/><br/>"I know what you're thinking: 'Scott, how is this possible?' Well, let me tell you, folks. I've been practicing my hypnosis skills in secret, and I'm proud to say that I can now control the minds of anyone who listens to my podcast."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Scott's wife Shelly was left looking like a deer in headlights, unsure what to do next.<br/><br/>"Uh, sorry about the confusion earlier," she stammered. "I guess Scott really is still alive... for now?"<br/><br/>As news of Scott's supposed demise spread, fans and fellow cartoonists alike took to social media to pay their respects.<br/><br/>"RIP Scott Adams? More like RISE Scott Adams!" tweeted @DilbertFan123.<br/><br/>"This guy's got more lives than a cat has lives," chimed in @CartoonistCrazy.<br/><br/>Scott, still very much alive and kicking, took to Twitter himself to announce the surprise news: "Breaking news: I'm not dead yet! Tune in next week for another episode of Real Coffee with Scott Adams, where we'll discuss the finer points of hypnosis and how to cheat death."<br/><br/>The world waits with bated breath as this drama unfolds.<br/><br/>Scott's podcast is now available on all major platforms, including Spotify, Apple Podcasts, and YouTube. Don't worry, he won't hypnotize you... or will he?<br/><br/>In related news, Scott Adams has been spotted at a local coffee shop, sipping on a latte and plotting his next move. When asked for comment, he simply winked and said "I'm not dead yet."<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Washington Post has announced that it will no longer publish Dilbert comics due to Scott's alleged racist comments. However, sources close to the cartoonist have revealed that he plans to sue them for defamation... of his own death.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
