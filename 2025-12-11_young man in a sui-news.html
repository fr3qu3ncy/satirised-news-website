        <h2>"THE ROCK HAS GOT HIS BACK! Costa Rican Smuggler Released from ICE Custody with New Charge: 'Making a Really Bad Decision'!"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Kilmar Abrego Garcia has been released from ICE custody, but only after being appointed a personal bodyguard by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson and having his human smuggling charges replaced with "Making a Really Bad Decision and Getting Caught".</p>
    </div>
  
    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Abrego Garcia Released from ICE Custody, Allowed to Return Home (Sort Of)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Judge Paula Xinis has ruled that Kilmar Abrego Garcia's detention by immigration authorities was "without lawful authority" and ordered his immediate release. But don't get too excited, folks, because this story is about to take a wild ride.<br/><br/>As Mr. Abrego Garcia prepares to return to his home in Maryland, he'll be doing it with a special guest - none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who's been hired as his personal bodyguard (don't ask). The Rock will be making sure that Mr. Abrego Garcia doesn't get deported again, mainly because the judge has already warned the government not to try anything funny.<br/><br/>But what about the human smuggling charges against Mr. Abrego Garcia? Don't worry, those have been dropped in favor of a new charge - "Making a Really Bad Decision and Getting Caught". It's a real thing, we swear.<br/><br/>In related news, the Department of Homeland Security has issued a statement saying that Judge Xinis' ruling was "naked judicial activism" and "lacks any valid legal basis". We're pretty sure they're just mad because their plans to deport Mr. Abrego Garcia to Uganda or Eswatini (we're not even kidding) have been foiled.<br/><br/>As for the judge's reasoning, it seems that she was quite adamant that immigration detention can't be used as a form of punishment or go on indefinitely. We're pretty sure she just didn't want to deal with the paperwork anymore.<br/><br/>In other news, Costa Rica has offered to take Mr. Abrego Garcia, but he's all like "Nah, I'll just stay in Maryland, thanks". And by "all like", we mean he actually said that in a statement to the press.<br/><br/>So there you have it - Kilmar Abrego Garcia is free to go ( sort of), and The Rock is on standby. What more could you ask for?</p>
