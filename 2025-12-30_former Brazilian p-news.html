        <p>BREAKING: Bolsonaro's Hiccups Saga Continues - and So Does the Madness!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has undergone his SECOND medical procedure for chronic hiccups in just three days. Yes, you read that right - TWO procedures in THREE DAYS. We're not even kidding.<br/><br/>According to sources (aka Dr. Google), Bolsonaro received a "phrenic nerve block procedure" on Monday to block his left phrenic nerve. Because, clearly, the first one didn't work out so well. His medical team must have thought, "Hey, let's just try again - after all, it's not like he has better things to do... like, say, RUNNING A COUNTRY!"<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking: "What about his hernia surgery? Did that go according to plan?" Well, spoiler alert: IT DIDN'T. We mean, who needs a successful surgery when you can just get some hiccups instead?<br/><br/>And let's not forget the drama surrounding his latest medical procedure! Bolsonaro's wife, Michelle (who is apparently also a medical expert), tweeted about her husband's "nine months of struggle and anguish with daily hiccups." Daily hiccups? That's like saying you're having a bad hair day... EVERY DAY.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in related news, Brazil's Supreme Court has allowed Bolsonaro to be transferred from federal police headquarters (aka PRISON) to a hospital for his medical procedures. Because, clearly, he couldn't possibly have any other pressing matters to attend to... like, say, HIS CIVILIAN APPEARANCE.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! His son Flávio has endorsed him to run against Brazil's President Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva in the 2026 presidential election. Because what the world really needs right now is a Bolsonaro comeback tour... with HICCUPS!<br/><br/>In conclusion, we'd like to say that Jair Bolsonaro's hiccups saga has officially reached new levels of absurdity. We're not even sure who to root for anymore - Team Hiccups or Team Sanity?</p>
