        <p>**BREAKING: South Korea's Most Epic Hack Ever!**<br/><br/>SEOUL, SOUTH KOREA - In a shocking turn of events, four people have been arrested for allegedly hacking over 120,000 video cameras in private homes, karaoke rooms, a Pilates studio, and even a gynaecologist's clinic. But that's not all - they used the hacked footage to create some seriously NSFW content for an overseas website.<br/><br/>Imagine walking into your local karaoke bar, only to find out that your drunken rendition of "I Will Survive" has been leaked online without your consent. Yeah, that's what happened here. The hackers exploited the vulnerabilities in Internet Protocol (IP) cameras - aka home cams - and used them to create a treasure trove of compromising videos.<br/><br/>The mastermind behind this operation, who shall remain nameless (but is actually named "John"), allegedly hacked 63,000 cameras and produced an impressive 545 sexually exploitative videos. He then sold these videos for the whopping sum of 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) in virtual assets.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Another suspect, known only by their handle "GamerBoy99," hacked a staggering 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for a mere 18 million won worth of assets. That's like getting paid to watch cat videos on YouTube - but not really.<br/><br/>The South Korean authorities have taken swift action, arresting three people who allegedly purchased and viewed this illicit content. They're also working with foreign agencies to investigate the operator of the website that hosted these compromising videos.<br/><br/>In a bold move, police have personally visited or notified victims at 58 locations, informing them of the incident and providing guidance on changing their passwords. Because, let's be real, if you can't even protect your own home cam password, how can we trust you with our national security?<br/><br/>**The Police Statement**<br/><br/>"We will eradicate these IP camera hacking and illegal filming offenses through vigorous investigations," said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency. "Viewing and possessing illegally filmed videos are also serious crimes, so we will actively investigate them." In other words, don't even think about trying to watch this stuff - you'll get caught!<br/><br/>**The People's Reactions**<br/><br/>"I had no idea my karaoke performances were being streamed online," said a local resident. "But I guess that explains why I was getting all those weird comments on social media."<br/><br/>"I'm just glad I changed my password last week," said another resident. "Guess I dodged a bullet there!"<br/><br/>**The Aftermath**<br/><br/>As for John and GamerBoy99, they're now facing the music - and possibly a life sentence in prison. The website that hosted this compromising content is being blocked and shut down, and foreign agencies are on the case.<br/><br/>So, to all you home cam owners out there: don't get too comfortable with your security cameras, or you might just find yourself starring in someone else's homemade porn flick!</p>
