    <div class="article">
        <p>CRANE-GATE: THE TRAIN WRECK OF THE CENTURY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a construction crane in Thailand has collapsed on a train, leaving at least 32 people dead and 64 others injured, including a one-year-old and an 85-year-old who are still trying to figure out what happened. It's like that time I tried to fold a fitted sheet and ended up with a pile of wrinkles.<br/><br/>The crane, which was being used to build an overhead railway, suddenly decided it had had enough of its job and took a swan dive onto the train, crushing several carriages and setting one on fire. Witnesses described the scene as "grim" and "like something out of a bad video game." One eyewitness, Maliwan Nakthon, said she was walking by when she saw the crane wobbling in the wind, thinking to herself, "Oh no, it's going to fall!" And then it did.<br/><br/>Thai Prime Minister Anutin Charnvirakul has promised to get to the bottom of this disaster and make sure someone pays for it. He said, "Accidents like this can only happen due to negligence, skipped steps, deviations from the design, or the use of incorrect materials... or maybe it was just a Tuesday." Anutin also announced that he will be visiting the scene of the accident later in the day, because what's an emergency without a selfie opportunity?<br/><br/>The Italian-Thai Development Company has apologized for the incident and promised to compensate the families of the victims. However, sources close to the company say they're still trying to figure out how to get the crane back on its legs. I mean, it's not like it's the first time they've had a problem with a building collapsing – remember that one skyscraper in Bangkok? Yeah, that was just a minor setback.<br/><br/>In other news, the Chinese embassy has issued a statement saying that no Chinese construction companies or workers were involved in the collapse, which is probably true because let's be real, who needs to get their hands dirty when you can just send some cash and a "good luck" wish? The Thai government has promised to take action against those responsible, but we all know how that goes – it'll be like trying to catch a chicken at the fair.<br/><br/>The train was carrying mostly students and workers traveling for school and work in other districts. I'm pretty sure that's code for "it was just a bunch of people trying to get to their 9-to-5 jobs on time." The incident has left many wondering how this could happen in modern times, but honestly, have you seen the traffic in Bangkok? It's like a real-life video game – except instead of leveling up, you just end up with a flat tire and a bunch of angry drivers honking at you.<br/><br/>The investigation into the accident is ongoing, but one thing is certain: it'll be a long and expensive process to get this train back on track. Or not. I mean, have you seen the price of trains in Thailand lately? It's like they're charging us per smiley face 😊.</p>
