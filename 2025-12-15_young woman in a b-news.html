        <p>BREAKING: Brown University Shooting Turns into Bizarre Comedy Spectacle<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the investigation into Saturday's shooting at Brown University has taken an unexpected detour into absurdity. Authorities are now searching for additional video evidence that could help them track down the suspect, but not before things got really weird.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the gunman – who was later revealed to be a man in all black clothing with a camouflage grey mask (because, you know, stealth mode) – entered the Barus and Holley engineering building during final exams. Students were seen scrambling for cover while attempting to study for their economics exam, because priorities.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get away from the shooter," said one student, "but then I remembered I had a calculus test coming up, so I went back to studying." Okay, cool.<br/><br/>The police investigation has also led to some... interesting discoveries. It turns out that the gunman's face was covered, but not before he yelled something at the students – possibly a really bad joke about derivatives? The police are still trying to piece together what exactly happened, but sources close to the investigation say it's "highly unlikely" they'll ever figure it out.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Brown University President Paxson has announced that all remaining in-person exams and classes for the semester have been cancelled. When asked why, she simply shrugged and said, "Why not? We can just stream lectures from the student union and call it a day." Students are thrilled.<br/><br/>The two students who were killed in the incident have been identified as Muhammad Aziz Umurzokov, an Uzbek-national with a passion for competitive snail racing (totally unrelated to the shooting), and Ella Cook, a 21-year-old who was known for her "bold, brave, and kind heart" – or possibly just her really good Spotify playlist.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Kendall Turner, an alumnus of Durham Academy in North Carolina, has been identified as one of those injured in the attack. When asked what he was doing at Brown University, Turner simply shrugged and said, "Just trying to get away from my parents' basement, dude."<br/><br/>And if you thought things couldn't get any weirder, just wait. The suspect is still on the loose, wearing a camouflage grey mask (because stealth mode, remember?) and a black hoodie with a giant cartoon banana printed on it – because who doesn't love a good laugh?<br/><br/>The investigation continues, but honestly, at this point, we're all just winging it.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've received word that Professor Rachel Friedberg has been placed under house arrest for "reckless endangerment of the student population through excessive use of analogies." We'll keep you updated on any further developments.</p>
