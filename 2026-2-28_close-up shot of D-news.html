        <p>BREAKING: Trump Launches "Major Combat Operations" in Iran, Claims He's Seeking Regime Change (But Really Just Wants to Get Back at His Ex)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has announced that major combat operations have begun in Iran. But let's be real, folks, this is just a cover for his real mission: getting back at his ex-girlfriend, Iran.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (aka my cousin Larry), Trump was heard yelling "You'll never take me alive, caviar!" as he launched the attack from his favorite golf course in Palm Springs.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Israeli Defence Minister Israel Katz has confirmed that Israel has launched a "pre-emptive" attack on Iran, because who needs diplomacy when you can just shoot first and ask questions later?<br/><br/>The BBC's Jon Donnison was on the scene in Jerusalem and reported seeing a projectile being shot down in the skies above east Jerusalem. When asked for comment, Trump simply shrugged and said, "What projectile? I didn't see anything."<br/><br/>Split screen image shows Trump in a tank, with a sign that reads "Regime Change" next to him<br/><br/>As tensions rise between Iran and the US, one thing is clear: Trump's ego has never been bigger. In fact, he's already started selling "I Iran" t-shirts online to raise funds for his presidential campaign (Spoiler alert: it won't be enough).<br/><br/>In related news, Greenland has issued a statement saying they're not interested in being taken over by the US, and that they're actually planning to build a wall around their island to keep out all the pesky Americans who just want to buy some cheap oil.<br/><br/>Watch as Trump tries to explain his plan for regime change to a confused-looking Joe Biden<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which will likely involve a lot more explosions and not much actual progress towards world peace.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news...<br/><br/>* The Lunar New Year celebrations are underway around the world, but let's be real, folks, it's all about the food – specifically the dumplings.<br/>* Russia has announced that they're ending their nuclear treaty with the US, because who needs rules when you can just nuke each other instead?<br/>* And in a shocking turn of events, the TikTok app has finally been banned from the US, but don't worry, it's still available on your grandma's phone.<br/><br/>That's all for now. Stay safe out there!</p>
