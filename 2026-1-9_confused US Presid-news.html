        <p>US President Donald Trump threatened to bomb more Nigeria if Christians don't stop being killed, but only sort of, because God told him to and also not really.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Trump Threatens to Bomb More Nigeria If Christians Don't Stop Being Killed (But Also Not Really)<br/><br/>In a shocking move, US President Donald Trump has warned that he might order more airstrikes on Nigeria if Christians continue to be killed there. But wait, it gets better! He also mentioned that this is not actually his decision, but rather, "the Lord above" told him to do so.<br/><br/>When asked about the Christmas Day strikes in Nigeria's northern Sokoto state, targeting Islamist militants, Trump replied, "I'd love to make it a one-time strike. But if they continue to kill Christians, I'll be like a kid on a sugar high - many-time strike, baby!"<br/><br/>Nigeria's government has rejected Trump's earlier accusations that it is failing to protect Christians from jihadist attacks, saying that "Muslims, Christians, and those of no faith alike" are targeted. Because, you know, Muslims love being targeted by airstrikes as much as Christians do.<br/><br/>Trump also claimed that most victims of the jihadist groups in Nigeria are actually Christians, which is like a math problem - 2 + 2 = 4... just kidding, it's actually "most of them are Muslims, but not really".<br/><br/>In response to Trump's comments, Nigeria's Foreign Minister Yusuf Maitama Tuggar said, "We will continue to engage constructively and work with partners, including the United States, on the basis of mutual respect, international law, and Nigeria's sovereignty. And also, please stop bombing us."<br/><br/>Meanwhile in Boko Haram-land...<br/><br/>The US and Nigerian government said after last month's airstrikes that the militants were linked to IS groups in the Sahel - although IS has not linked itself to any of the group's activities or announced ties to Lakurawa as it has done with other groups in the region that it backs.<br/><br/>In related news, Lakurawa, the jihadist group targeted by the airstrikes, was seen eating a bowl of spaghetti and wondering why they got bombed on Christmas Day. "It's just not fair," said one militant. "We were just trying to enjoy some festive cheer... with our AK-47s."<br/><br/>Side Note: Why is Trump always talking about Nigeria?<br/><br/>Trump has a long history of making confusing statements about Nigeria, including calling it a "country of particular concern" because of what he said was the "existential threat" to its Christian population. We're pretty sure that's just code for "I love Nigerian oil".<br/><br/>Anyway, back to the important stuff: did you know that the US has a top-secret team of ninjas who can infiltrate Boko Haram camps and steal all their snacks? It's true! They're like Nigeria's version of Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>Final Thoughts: Who needs diplomacy when you have Twitter?<br/><br/>In conclusion, Trump's statement was just another example of his commitment to using Twitter as a foreign policy tool. Because what could possibly go wrong with threatening airstrikes on a country via tweet?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the world of Nigerian politics and Boko Haram drama!</p>
