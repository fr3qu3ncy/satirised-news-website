        <p>A man tried to steal a $19,000 Fabergé egg by eating it, and when that didn't quite work out as planned, he ended up "pooping it out" in a bizarre incident that left authorities and witnesses utterly bewildered.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Man Eats Fabergé Egg, Cops Recover in 'Natural Manner'<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities baffled, a man was arrested for allegedly trying to steal a $19,000 diamond-studded egg named after the James Bond film Octopussy. But what's even more astonishing is that he tried to swallow it whole.<br/><br/>According to sources, the 32-year-old man walked into Partridge Jewellers in central Auckland, New Zealand, and stuffed the Fabergé egg locket into his mouth. Witnesses claim he then tried to make a run for it, but was quickly apprehended by police.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad action movie," said one witness. "I mean, who tries to steal a Fabergé egg by eating it? It's just not how you do things."<br/><br/>Police say the man has been charged with theft and is currently being held in custody. But in a surprising twist, they announced that the Fabergé egg had been recovered in a "natural manner" – meaning the guy literally pooped it out.<br/><br/>"We're happy to report that the suspect has undergone a medical assessment and is no longer a biohazard," said a spokesperson for the police department. "We're just relieved that nobody was hurt... except maybe the guy's stomach lining."<br/><br/>The Fabergé egg, which features an 18-carat gold miniature octopus and is set with 60 white diamonds and 15 blue sapphires, will reportedly be returned to its rightful owner – a certain Bond villain, no doubt.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, a baby seal was spotted walking into a bar in Richmond, New Zealand, while Harry Brook from England's cricket team is facing debutants Italy at the 2026 T20 World Cup.</p>
