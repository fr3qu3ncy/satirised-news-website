        <p>BREAKING: Brett Ratner Spotted Cuddling with Mystery Woman, Trump Documentary Still Unpopular<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, renowned director Brett Ratner has been caught on camera snuggled up with an unidentified young woman, sending shockwaves throughout the entertainment industry. The image, which was released by the US Department of Justice on Friday, shows Ratner and his mystery friend lounging on a couch alongside the late sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even juicier! This bombshell news dropped on the same day that Ratner's documentary about Melania Trump hit theaters. Yes, you read that right – the very same film that has been met with widespread criticism and skepticism from critics and audiences alike.<br/><br/>The photo, which appears to have been taken in the same location as other Epstein-related images released last December, shows Ratner and his mystery date cozying up next to Epstein, who's sporting a rather unsettling grin. The image has left many questioning whether this is just another example of Ratner's questionable taste in friends or something more sinister.<br/><br/>The timing of this revelation couldn't be more impeccable. I mean, what better way to distract from the fact that your documentary about Melania Trump is tanking than by releasing a photo of yourself cuddling with a mysterious woman? It's like Ratner wanted to make everyone forget about the #MeToo movement and his own alleged misdeeds.<br/><br/>Ratner has faced numerous accusations of sexual misconduct in the past, which he has vehemently denied. However, this latest image raises more questions than answers. Is this just another example of Ratner's poor judgment or a deliberate attempt to deflect attention from his documentary's lackluster performance?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Epstein's connection to high-profile figures continues to unravel, with new images revealing him cozying up with everyone from Elon Musk to Lord Peter Mandelson. It seems the late financier had an impressive Rolodex of famous friends, many of whom are now facing their own scandals.<br/><br/>In related news, a 5-year-old boy and his father were detained by ICE last week but have since been released back to Minnesota. Yes, you read that right – a 5-year-old boy was caught up in the middle of an immigration controversy. Who knew ICE had such a keen eye for tiny troublemakers?<br/><br/>As for Ratner's documentary about Melania Trump, well... let's just say it's not exactly setting the box office on fire. I mean, who wouldn't want to watch a film about the First Lady's daily life leading up to her husband's inauguration? It's like watching paint dry – only less exciting.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. Brett Ratner cuddling with a mystery woman while his documentary about Melania Trump tanked. Who knew politics and entertainment could get so complicated?<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Los Angeles 2028 Olympics chief has come forward to "deeply regret" sending flirty emails to Ghislaine Maxwell. Yeah, because that's exactly what we needed – another Olympic-sized scandal.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
