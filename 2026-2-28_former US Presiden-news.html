        <p>BREAKING: Clinton's Testimony Shakes the Nation<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former US President Bill Clinton testified before the House Oversight committee yesterday, denying any knowledge of convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein's crimes. When asked about a photograph from the Epstein files that shows him in a hot tub with an unidentified person (who appears to be a woman), Clinton claimed he had no idea who she was. "I've never met her," Clinton said, before being interrupted by a loud "Boo!" from the back of the room.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Clinton's wife Hillary was also deposed by the committee on Friday, where she maintained a stoic expression throughout the entire testimony. When asked about her husband's relationship with Epstein, she simply replied, "I'm not here to discuss my husband's sex life." The crowd erupted in cheers and applause at this revelation.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! In a bizarre twist, Clinton was spotted leaving the committee room wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and a pair of oversized novelty sunglasses. When asked why he was dressed like a 70s disco star, Clinton replied, "I'm just trying to make a statement about the absurdity of this whole situation."<br/><br/>And what's even more ridiculous? The entire testimony took place during a sudden power outage in the committee room. Candles were lit, and the proceedings continued as if nothing had happened. It was like they were filming a scene from "The Walking Dead" or something.<br/><br/>In related news, Clinton has announced his candidacy for the next season of "Survivor," citing his ability to "outwit, outplay, and outlast" any opponent as evidence of his qualifications. His campaign slogan? "I'm not just a president, I'm a SURVIVOR!"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Clinton's campaign team has issued a statement saying that he is actually running for President of the United States... again. When asked about his chances, Clinton replied, "I'm like a fine wine – I get better with age." We're not sure what to make of this, but we're pretty sure it involves a lot of wine.<br/><br/>AND ANOTHER UPDATE: The FBI has just announced that they are launching an investigation into Clinton's claims of having no knowledge about Epstein's crimes. When asked for comment, Clinton said, "I'm shocked – SHOCKED! – that the FBI would even consider investigating me." We're not sure what to make of this either, but we're pretty sure it involves a lot of outrage and indignation.<br/><br/>FINAL UPDATE: In a shocking turn of events, Lady Gaga has just announced her candidacy for President of the United States. When asked about her qualifications, she replied, "I'm like a fine wine – I get better with age... and a little bit of cheese." We're not sure what to make of this either, but we're pretty sure it involves a lot of sparkles and confetti.<br/><br/>And that's a wrap, folks!</p>
