        <p>Breaking News: Tarique Rahman Returns to Bangladesh, Brings Pizza and Video Games<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Tarique Rahman, the front-runner to be the next prime minister of Bangladesh, has returned to the country after 17 years in exile. But this time, he's not alone - he's brought his favorite pizza toppings and a console full of video games.<br/><br/>Rahman, who has spent the past decade-and-a-half living in London, was greeted by supporters in Dhaka on Thursday, waving a giant inflatable chicken from the window of a bus while surrounded by security. The crowd went wild as he shouted "I'm back, baby!" and proceeded to order a large pepperoni pizza for himself.<br/><br/>The 60-year-old Rahman is expected to become the country's new leader if his party, the Bangladesh Nationalist Party (BNP), emerges as the largest party in the upcoming elections. But first, he's got some pressing matters to attend to - like conquering the newly released video game "Fortnite" on his Xbox.<br/><br/>"I'm excited to finally get back to my roots and lead this great nation," Rahman said in a statement, while simultaneously high-fiving a group of passing schoolchildren. "And let me tell you, I've got some fantastic ideas for the country's economic growth - like investing in a national pizza chain and building an arcade on every street corner."<br/><br/>The return of Rahman has sent shockwaves throughout the country, with many residents taking to social media to express their excitement and/or horror at the news. "OMG, Tarique is back!" tweeted @BangladeshiBaba. Meanwhile, @ConcernedCitizen22 wrote, "Uh, isn't this guy a convicted criminal? Shouldn't we be worried about his return?"<br/><br/>Rahman's party has denied any wrongdoing on his part and claims he was unfairly targeted by the previous government. In fact, they're now accusing the current administration of being responsible for a recent wave of student-led protests, which have seen several buildings set ablaze.<br/><br/>"This is all just a clever ploy to distract us from Tarique's brilliant plans for our great nation," said a BNP spokesperson, while simultaneously munching on a slice of pizza. "We will not be swayed by these baseless allegations and will instead focus on building a brighter future for Bangladesh - with more video games and fewer pesky protests."<br/><br/>As the country teeters on the brink of chaos, one thing is certain: Tarique Rahman's return has brought a spark of excitement to the nation. And if all else fails, there's always pizza.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Reports are emerging that Tarique Rahman's security detail includes a team of highly trained ninja warriors, who have been tasked with protecting him from any potential threats. Sources close to the prime minister-in-waiting say this move is purely precautionary and has nothing to do with his alleged involvement in several high-profile heists.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED: For more updates on Tarique Rahman's return and the unfolding drama in Bangladesh, stay tuned to our live blog - or just check out our Instagram account for constant updates, memes, and pizza-related content.</p>
