        <p>BREAKING: Saudi Arabia Sets New Record for Most People Executed Annually - Again! (And Some Other Stuff Happens)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the kingdom of Saudi Arabia has once again surpassed its own record for most people executed annually. Because what's a little bit of bloodshed and human rights abuses among friends? According to sources (okay, it's just Reprieve, a UK-based campaign group that tracks executions in Saudi Arabia), at least 347 people have now been put to death this year, up from the previous record of 345 set in 2024.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The majority of these executions were for non-lethal drug-related offenses, which is basically just a fancy way of saying "people got executed for having some weed." Yeah, because that's exactly what you want to do when trying to diversify your economy away from oil - execute people for getting high. I mean, who needs tourism or innovation when you can have beheadings and firing squads?<br/><br/>Now, let's talk about the real mastermind behind this "war on drugs" in Saudi Arabia: Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman (aka MBS, aka the guy with the fancy haircut). This dude has been changing the country profoundly over the past few years, loosening social restrictions while simultaneously silencing criticism. It's like he's saying, "Hey, I'll let you have your freedom... as long as you don't speak out against my human rights abuses."<br/><br/>But hey, at least he's good for entertainment events and sporting events, right? Because what's a little bit of bloodshed when there are concerts to attend?<br/><br/>As Reprieve's Jeed Basyouni so eloquently put it: "Saudi Arabia is operating with complete impunity now. It's almost making a mockery of the human rights system." And I'm like, "Yeah, because that's exactly what you want to do when trying to become a global leader - ignore human rights and get away with it."<br/><br/>And let's not forget about the families of those executed! They're usually not even informed in advance or given the body, or told where they've been buried. It's like, "Hey, don't worry about your loved one, just move on with your life." I mean, who needs closure when you can have a good night's sleep?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks - Saudi Arabia: where human rights abuses and execution records are always the top priority!</p>
