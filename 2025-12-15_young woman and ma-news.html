        <p>BREAKING: Brown University Massacre Update<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two students were killed and nine others were injured in a shooting at Brown University on Saturday. But don't worry, folks, the good news is that the investigation has led to the detention... wait for it... of a hotel guest who was later released without charges.<br/><br/>Sources close to the investigation (i.e., my cousin's neighbor) revealed that the police had been searching for a person in black clothing, but it turns out they were looking for a hipster from Brooklyn. "We thought he was the one," said Providence Police Chief Col Oscar Perez. "But then we saw him sipping a matcha latte and we realized he was just there to attend a poetry slam."<br/><br/>As the investigation continues, authorities are urging everyone on campus to be vigilant... or at least to carry a selfie stick with them at all times. After all, you never know when a rogue photographer might show up.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre twist, the families of the two deceased students have hired a team of lawyers to sue Brown University for not providing enough parking spots near the scene of the crime. "It's a travesty," said Ella Cook's mom. "My daughter was killed and now we can't even park our car?"<br/><br/>The White House has issued a statement expressing condolences to the victims' families, but only after President Donald Trump tweeted about how he hopes the injured students "get well fast" while simultaneously promoting his new line of golf balls.<br/><br/>And in related news, the Uzbekistan Ministry of Foreign Affairs has released a statement saying they're "deeply saddened" by the loss of Mr. Umurzakov, but only because it's bad for their country's international reputation.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks, as this story continues to unfold like a bad soap opera. And remember: if you see someone in black clothing, don't panic – just call your local hipster and ask them to take a selfie with you.</p>
