    <div class="article">
        <p>TRUMP DECLARES VENEZUELA WILL BE "UP AND RUNNING" WITH 50 MILLION BARRELS OF OIL, WHILE CHINA TELLS HIM TO "STOP BEING SUCH A BIG BABY"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Trump announced yesterday that Venezuela will be turning over up to 50 million barrels of oil to the US within 18 months. The oil, which is valued at approximately $2.8 billion, will be sold at market price and controlled by Trump himself.<br/><br/>"I'm pleased to announce that the Interim Authorities in Venezuela will be turning over between 30 and 50 MILLION Barrels of High Quality, Sanctioned Oil, to the United States of America," Trump tweeted on Truth Social, while simultaneously eating a bag of Cheetos and watching reruns of "The Price is Right".<br/><br/>This announcement comes as a surprise to many, considering Venezuela's oil production has been in decline since the early 2000s. Analysts previously told the BBC that it could take tens of billions of dollars - and potentially a decade - to restore Venezuela's former output.<br/><br/>But Trump is undeterred, claiming that US oil companies can fix Venezuela's oil infrastructure with ease. "Having a Venezuela that's an oil producer is good for the United States because it keeps the price of oil down," he told NBC News on Monday, while sipping on a Starbucks latte and wearing a "Make America Great Again" hat.<br/><br/>However, China has come out swinging against Trump's plans, condemning his "blatant military action against Venezuela" and demanding that Venezuela prioritize Chinese interests. "Stop being such a big baby, Mr. President," said a spokesperson for the Chinese foreign ministry. "You can't just waltz in here and start telling us what to do with our oil."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, representatives from major US petroleum companies were spotted at Trump's office building this week, nervously sipping coffee and whispering among themselves about the feasibility of Trump's plans.<br/><br/>One such representative, a spokesperson for ExxonMobil, was overheard saying, "Uh, Mr. President? We think it might be a good idea to have, like, some actual oil production agreements in place before we start making promises to the public?"<br/><br/>Trump, taken aback by this suggestion, retorted, "Don't worry about that, folks! I've got everything under control. Trust me, I know what I'm doing."<br/><br/>And so, the world waits with bated breath as Venezuela's oil industry is transformed into a Trump-branded theme park, complete with a Ferris wheel made out of oil barrels and a souvenir shop selling "Make Oil Great Again" t-shirts.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Venezuelan government has just announced that they will be hosting a massive rave party to celebrate Trump's announcement, featuring a special guest appearance by the cast of "Riverdance".<br/><br/>"We're thrilled to have President Trump come and experience the vibrant culture of Venezuela firsthand," said an official spokesperson. "And who knows? Maybe he'll even get to sing along with us during the chorus of 'The Wind Beneath My Wings'!"<br/><br/>ANOTHER UPDATE: The United Nations has just issued a statement condemning Trump's plans as "utter nonsense" and urging world leaders to take immediate action to prevent this catastrophe from unfolding.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Elton John has been spotted backstage at the rave party, wearing a pair of oversized sunglasses and muttering something about "another one bites the dust".<br/><br/>AND FINALLY: The White House has just announced that they will be renaming Venezuela "Venezuela-Tron" in honor of Trump's new theme park-style vision for the country.<br/><br/>We're not kidding. They actually used the hashtag #VenezuelaTron on their official Twitter account, followed by a bunch of emojis and a picture of Trump riding a unicorn through a field of oil barrels.<br/><br/>It's happening, folks. The apocalypse is nigh.</p>
