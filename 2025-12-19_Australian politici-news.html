        <p>BREAKING: Australia Announces Gun Buyback Scheme, Because You Can Never Have Too Many Elvis Impersonators on Bondi Beach<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the Australian government has announced a massive gun buyback scheme in response to the recent Bondi Beach attack. But let's be real, folks, this is just an excuse to get all the guns off the streets so we can finally have a decent game of cricket without anyone accidentally shooting themselves with a Nerf gun.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Prime Minister, Anthony Albanese was overheard saying, "We need to get all these guns out of circulation so we can go back to our usual activities – like trying to get a parking spot on Bondi Beach without getting shot at by a guy in a tutu." When asked for clarification, Albanese's spokesperson replied, "Uh, no, that's not what he meant. He actually said, 'We need to get all these guns out of circulation so we can go back to our usual activities – like trying to get a parking spot on Bondi Beach without getting shot at by a guy in a tutu who's wearing a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt.'"<br/><br/>The scheme is expected to be one of the largest since the Port Arthur massacre in 1996, which left 35 people dead and prompted Australia to introduce world-leading gun control measures. Or as we like to call it, "the Port Arthur incident," because, you know, who needs a proper name when you can just have a nice alliterative one?<br/><br/>The government has promised that the scheme will be fully funded by a combination of taxpayers' money and donations from local Elvis impersonators, who are eager to get rid of their extensive collections of firearms so they can focus on perfecting their "Burnin' Love" dance moves.<br/><br/>In related news, the Australian Federal Police Commissioner, Krissy Barrett, was overheard saying, "We're not just looking for guns; we're also looking for any evidence of alien life forms, because let's face it, folks, if there are aliens on this planet, they're probably the ones who started all these gun attacks." When asked to clarify, Commissioner Barrett replied, "Uh, no, I meant that as a joke. But honestly, have you seen the size of those sheep on Bondi Beach? They look like they could be extraterrestrial life forms or something."<br/><br/>The scheme is expected to be a huge success, mainly because it's not like people are going to actually hand over their guns willingly or anything. I mean, who needs a gun when you've got a good pair of binoculars and a sturdy pair of walking shoes, right?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks – another chance for Australia to prove that we're the land down under where everything is sunshine and rainbows (except on Bondi Beach, where it's usually just sunshine and screaming Elvis impersonators).<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, or as we like to call it, "the ongoing saga of Australian politicians trying to figure out how to get rid of all the guns so they can have a decent game of cricket without anyone accidentally shooting themselves with a Nerf gun."</p>
