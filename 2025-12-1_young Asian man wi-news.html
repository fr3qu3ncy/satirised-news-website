        <p>**BREAKING: South Korean Authorities Arrest Four for Hacking Over 120,000 Home Cameras and Using Footage for "Sexy" Exploitation**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, four individuals have been apprehended by South Korean authorities for allegedly hacking into over 120,000 video cameras in private homes and businesses. But wait, it gets juicier! These hackers didn't just steal your grandma's secret recipe; no, they used the footage to create a series of erotic videos that would make even the most seasoned sex-obsessed teenager blush.<br/><br/>According to sources, the IP cameras (aka home cams) were installed in various locations, including private homes, karaoke rooms, a Pilates studio, and yes, you guessed it – a gynaecologist's clinic! Because who doesn't want to watch a doc doin' his thing while singin' "I Will Survive"?<br/><br/>The four suspects, who operated independently of each other (because who needs friends when you're busy hacking home cams?), allegedly hacked into the cameras using simple passwords. One of them, identified as Kim Jong-Pil, is accused of stealing 63,000 cameras and producing a staggering 545 sexually exploitative videos, which he then sold for an impressive 35 million won ($12,235; £9,250) worth of virtual assets.<br/><br/>But that's not all, folks! Another suspect, Park Ji-Hoon, allegedly hacked into 70,000 cameras and sold 648 videos for a whopping 18 million won worth of assets. And get this – the two suspects were responsible for approximately 62% of videos posted on an overseas website that illegally distributed IP camera hacking footage!<br/><br/>Police are now working tirelessly to block and shut down the aforementioned website, while also cooperating with foreign agencies to investigate its operator. Three people have been arrested for allegedly buying and viewing material through the site.<br/><br/>"IP camera hacking and illegal filming inflict immense suffering on victims and are therefore serious offences," said Park Woo-hyun, a cyber investigation chief at the National Police Agency. "We will eradicate them through vigorous investigations... Viewership is also a crime, so we'll catch those bums too!"<br/><br/>Additional reporting by Leehyun Choi, who's still trying to process the sheer magnitude of this scandal.</p>
