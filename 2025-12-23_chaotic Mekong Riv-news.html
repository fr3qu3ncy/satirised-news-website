        <p>BREAKING: Tourists Go BANANAS in Laos Ferry Disaster<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a ferry carrying 147 people - mostly tourists and a few locals who were just there for the free beer - capsized on the Mekong River in Laos. But don't worry, folks! Only three people are missing, and by "missing," I mean they're probably off island-hopping somewhere with their inflatable flamingos.<br/><br/>Anthonin, a 30-year-old French citizen (because who doesn't love a good croissant with their boat ride?), described the scene as "absolute chaos" - mainly because everyone was running around like headless chickens trying to find their lost selfie sticks. He said, "It was like a giant game of musical chairs... but instead of chairs, it was life jackets, and instead of music, it was people screaming for help."<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "But wait, didn't the crew have enough life jackets?" Well, according to Anthonin, they had about 15 life jackets - which is just a bunch of hooey! It's like saying, "Hey, we've got a first-aid kit... and it's only missing one Band-Aid." I mean, who needs that many life jackets when you've got the whole river to play in?<br/><br/>And let's not forget about Gabrielius Baranovičius, the 19-year-old Lithuanian tourist who thought it'd be funny to film the whole thing on his phone... until he realized people were actually drowning. That's like me taking a selfie with a shark fin in the background and then panicking because I forgot my sunscreen.<br/><br/>As for Bradley Cook, the British tourist who survived the ordeal by jumping onto the rescue boat and doing some sort of ninja-style escape from the sinking ferry, he said it was "terrifying" - mainly because everyone thought he stole their snacks. He told the BBC, "I'm not sure how avoidable this was... but I do know one thing: I'm never using slow boats again."<br/><br/>And finally, let's talk about the poor Lao mother and her two children who went missing in the chaos. Well, it looks like they were just on a little adventure of their own - probably searching for the last remaining donuts on the ferry.<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you ever find yourself on a boat ride through Laos, just remember: there's always room for more people... and life jackets.</p>
