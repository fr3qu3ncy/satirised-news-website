        <p>BREAKING: Hollywood Couple Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors Become Guinea Citizens After DNA Tests, But Not Without a Few Hiccups<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Hollywood power couple Meagan Good and Jonathan Majors have become citizens of Guinea after tracing their ancestry to the West African nation through DNA testing. But, as is often the case with these sorts of things, it's not been without its share of drama.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the couple arrived at Conakry's Gbessia International Airport on Friday morning, where they were greeted by officials and musicians, including a troupe of dancing chimpanzees in matching Guinea flag-print onesies. Yes, you read that right - chimpanzees. It was...a sight.<br/><br/>After being presented with kola nuts (which, let's be real, is just a fancy way of saying "welcome to our country, we hope you like it here"), the couple were whisked away to a private cultural ceremony at the Gbassi Kolo tourist and cultural centre, where they were officially handed their Guinea passports by Minister and Chief of Staff Djiba Diakité.<br/><br/>But things took a turn for the absurd when Majors, resplendent in his yellow jumper and beige slacks, attempted to give an impromptu speech on the importance of African heritage, only to be interrupted by a group of rowdy schoolchildren chanting "We want pizza!" It was...a moment.<br/><br/>Despite this, Good and Majors were all smiles as they posed for photos with their new Guinea friends, all while wearing matching "I'm with stupid" t-shirts that inexplicably featured a picture of Arnold Schwarzenegger on them. We're still not sure what that was about.<br/><br/>In a statement to the BBC, the couple said they were thrilled to become citizens of Guinea and looked forward to spending more time in the country, possibly even investing in a few local businesses (though it's worth noting that Good has already invested in a line of artisanal African-themed coffee mugs, so maybe that's where their true priorities lie).<br/><br/>It's all part of a new trend among US celebrities reconnecting with their African heritage and taking up citizenships in various African nations. Stevie Wonder, Ciara, and Samuel L Jackson have all done the same in recent years, though we're not sure what they've got planned next - perhaps a tour of Guinea's historic slave trade sites, accompanied by a troupe of dancing chimpanzees?<br/><br/>Only time will tell.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>We've just received word that Good and Majors have been spotted at a local market in Conakry, haggling with vendors over the price of a few dozen Guinea flags to be used as makeshift tablecloths for their upcoming dinner party. We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that they're trying to negotiate the price of national flags or the fact that they thought it was a good idea to have a dinner party in the first place.<br/><br/>ANOTHER UPDATE:<br/><br/>Sources close to the couple have revealed that they've been secretly taking DNA tests on their friends and family members, using the results to construct an elaborate family tree that somehow includes David Hasselhoff. We're not sure what's more bizarre - the fact that they're trying to connect themselves to a fictional ancestral line or the fact that David Hasselhoff has somehow become involved in all of this.<br/><br/>FINAL UPDATE:<br/><br/>We've just been informed that Good and Majors have been forced to leave Guinea after their dinner party was shut down by local authorities due to concerns over their tablecloth usage. We're not sure what's more surprising - the fact that they tried to use national flags as tablecloths or the fact that they managed to get themselves kicked out of a country for trying to do so.<br/><br/>And that's...that.</p>
