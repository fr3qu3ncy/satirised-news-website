        <p>COMEDY VERSION OF THE NEWS ARTICLE<br/><br/>"RUSSIA HITS UKRAINE WITH RARELY USED ORESHNIK MISSILE, BUT IT WASN'T JUST ANY OLD STRIKE. IT WAS LIKE A CIRCUS OUT THERE!"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russia decided to use the rarely used Oreshnik ballistic missile to hit Ukraine. And by "shocking," we mean it was completely expected and not at all surprising.<br/><br/>According to sources, the missile was launched from Moscow (or maybe it was just a guy in a Batman costume throwing a water balloon? We're not really sure) and landed with a thud in Ukraine, causing what can only be described as "a lot of explosions" and some general chaos.<br/><br/>Four people were killed and 25 others injured in Kyiv, which is a real shame because we heard the city's coffee shop game was on point that day. A paramedic was among those killed, which is like, super sad, man. I mean, who doesn't love a good rescue mission?<br/><br/>But here's the thing: Russia's defense ministry said the strike was a response to a Ukrainian drone attack targeting Vladimir Putin's residence in late December. And by "drone attack," we mean probably just some kid with a toy drone who accidentally flew it into Putin's house and set off the fire alarms.<br/><br/>It's worth noting that Ukraine denies carrying out any such attack, which is like, totally believable because have you seen the price of drones lately? It's like, $500 for a decent one! Who needs a functioning democracy when you can just buy some drone parts online?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Volodymyr Zelensky and Ukrainian authorities confirmed that a ballistic missile had struck infrastructure in Lviv, about 60km (40 miles) from the Polish border. Which is great, because Poland was already having a bad week.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The Oreshnik is an intermediate-range, hypersonic ballistic missile, meaning it can potentially reach up to 5,500km (3,417 miles). It's like, who needs a functioning space program when you can just launch a bunch of missiles into the sky and hope for the best?<br/><br/>And let's not forget about the EU foreign policy chief Kaja Kallas, who said Russia's Oreshnik strike was meant as a warning to Europe and the US. Yeah, because nothing says " warning" like a 5,500km missile that might or might not actually work.<br/><br/>All in all, it's just another day in Ukraine, where the only thing more plentiful than explosions is the number of times Russia claims something happened when probably nothing did.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY! (OR NOT.)<br/><br/>SIDEBAR:<br/><br/>* In related news, a group of hipsters in Kyiv have started a Kickstarter campaign to fund their own drone attack on Putin's house. They've already raised $100 and are expecting to reach their goal of $10,000 by the end of the week.<br/>* Meanwhile, a group of Ukrainian soldiers has taken to singing "YMCA" by the Village People to boost morale during the ongoing conflict. It's like, totally working!<br/>* And in other news, Putin has been spotted riding a unicorn through the streets of Moscow while shouting "I'M THE BOSS!" at the top of his lungs. No word yet on whether this is actually happening or just some guy dressed up as Putin having fun.<br/><br/>THIS IS NOT A DRILL (OR IS IT?).</p>
