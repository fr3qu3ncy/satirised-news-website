        <p>COMEDY VERSION<br/><br/>BREAKING: UN Security Council Meets to Discuss US Seizure of Two Oil Tankers, Featuring an Unlikely Guest - Danny DeVito<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United Nations Security Council convened an emergency meeting to discuss the recent seizure of two Venezuelan oil tankers by the United States. But what made this gathering truly unforgettable was the surprise appearance of none other than Danny DeVito.<br/><br/>As the ambassadors from various countries began to bicker and shout at each other, a tiny, wise-cracking figure emerged from the wings. "Hey, hey, hey! What's all the hubbub about?" DeVito exclaimed, his eyes twinkling with mischief.<br/><br/>The Venezuelan ambassador, Samuel Moncada, was taken aback by the sudden arrival of the actor. "Uh, Mr. DeVito? I'm not sure what you're doing here."<br/><br/>"Hey, kid," DeVito replied, winking at the camera, "I heard there was free donuts in the cafeteria. But seriously, what's going on? Did someone say something about oil tankers?"<br/><br/>The US ambassador, Michael Waltz, scowled at DeVito. "This is a serious matter, sir. We cannot have countries just... taking our oil."<br/><br/>DeVito snorted. "Oh, come on, Mike! You're not going to give us the old 'oil-igarchy' routine again, are you?"<br/><br/>As the debate continued, DeVito wandered around the council chamber, cracking jokes and distributing flyers for his latest movie, "It's Always Sunny in Venezuela."<br/><br/>At one point, he even hijacked a diplomatic speech by China's ambassador, Sun Lei. "Sorry, sorry, my friend," DeVito interrupted, holding up his hands. "But I think we've got a better slogan: 'Make America Laugh Again'!"<br/><br/>The council chamber erupted into chaos as ambassadors from various countries shouted over each other and pointed fingers at DeVito.<br/><br/>Finally, the UN Secretary-General intervened, ordering security to remove DeVito from the premises. As he was dragged away, shouting "Free donuts! I'll be back!" DeVito called out to the Venezuelan ambassador, "Hey, kid! You're on my list for a future episode of 'It's Always Sunny in Venezuela'!"<br/><br/>As the meeting continued without him, the council members couldn't help but chuckle at the absurdity of it all. Who knew that an emergency UN Security Council meeting could be so... entertaining?<br/><br/>And Danny DeVito? He was last seen walking out of the UN building with a free donut and a knowing grin.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Venezuelan ambassador has released a statement saying, "We're not laughing about this. We're just... enjoying the free entertainment."<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* Danny DeVito Wins Third Oscar for Best Supporting Actor in a Comedy<br/>* Venezuela Introduces New National Pastime: Watching Danny DeVito Movies on Repeat<br/>* UN Secretary-General Awards Danny DeVito Honorary Diploma for "Contributions to International Chaos"</p>
