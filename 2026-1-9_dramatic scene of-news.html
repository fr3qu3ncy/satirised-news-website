        <p>"LANDFILL IN CEBU GOES HORRIBLY WRONG: 12 SANITATION WORKERS INJURED, 30 MISSING, AND ONE GUY WHO JUST WANTED A QUIET LUNCH WITH HIS TACO GETS CAUGHT IN THE DEBRIS"<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, a private landfill in Cebu City, Philippines has turned into a scene from a horror movie. Or rather, a scene from a terrible comedy sketch. The Binaliw Landfill, which is roughly the size of a small theme park, collapsed on Thursday, killing one woman and injuring 12 sanitation workers.<br/><br/>The cause of the collapse? Well, it's not exactly clear, but officials suspect it might have something to do with poor waste management practices... or maybe just bad juju. The landfill was run by a private company, because what could possibly go wrong when you privatize trash disposal?<br/><br/>Rescuers were quick to respond, and by "respond," I mean they showed up in about an hour after the incident happened. They pulled 12 injured sanitation workers from the debris, but many more people are still missing. In fact, so many people are missing that it's like they're trying to avoid paying their parking tickets.<br/><br/>One of the missing workers is a guy named Juan who just wanted to grab a quiet lunch with his taco at the landfill. He was in the middle of eating when suddenly, KABOOM! The whole place came crashing down around him. Now he's stuck under a pile of trash and can't get out because his pants are too tight.<br/><br/>As for the rescuers, they're doing their best to find survivors, but it's like they're searching for a needle in a haystack... or rather, a taco in a landfill. "We're racing against the clock," said Cebu Mayor Nestor Archival, who was quoted by ABS-CBN as saying that finding survivors is like trying to find a decent Wi-Fi signal at a crowded coffee shop.<br/><br/>The mayor also warned that it might be difficult to reach any potential survivors because of the potential for further collapse. But hey, what's a little cave-in when you're trying to get rid of some trash, right? It's not like anyone was hurt or anything... oh wait, 30 people are still missing and one person is dead.<br/><br/>The Binaliw Landfill is now on lockdown until further notice, which means that anyone who tries to sneak in will be subject to a rigorous background check... or at least, a good pat down by the security guards. Because let's face it, if you're trying to get into a private landfill, there might be something fishy going on.<br/><br/>In related news, the city of Cebu has announced plans to upgrade its waste management system to "something slightly less terrible." The new system will include a state-of-the-art trash compacting machine that can compress an entire year's worth of garbage into one neat little package... which is perfect for sending back to the landfill where it all started.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, folks!</p>
