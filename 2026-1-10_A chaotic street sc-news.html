        <p>HUNDREDS OF PEOPLE KILLED AND INJURED BY SECURITY FORCES IN IRAN; HOSPITALS OVERWHELMED WITH DEAD AND WOUNDED PROTESTERS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, security forces in Iran have been accused of using excessive force against protesters, resulting in hundreds of people being killed and injured. The situation has become so dire that hospitals are overwhelmed with dead and wounded protesters, with one hospital worker describing the scene as "like something out of a horror movie."<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that security forces have been using live ammunition and pellets to disperse crowds, with many protesters being shot in the head or heart. One medic reported treating gunshot wounds from both live ammunition and pellets, saying "it's like they're trying to turn the streets into a war zone." Another doctor described seeing one person who had been shot in the eye, with the bullet exiting from the back of his head.<br/><br/>But it gets even better. In a bizarre twist, a group of protesters were spotted wearing chicken costumes and doing the cha cha slide while being chased by security forces. Witnesses claim that the protesters were "dancing for their lives" as they tried to evade arrest. When asked about this peculiar sighting, an Iranian government spokesperson simply shrugged and said "it's all just part of the usual Friday night protests."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Trump has weighed in on the situation, tweeting "Iran is looking at FREEDOM, perhaps like never before. The USA stands ready to help!!!". When asked for clarification, a White House spokesperson explained that the President was simply trying to offer his support to the protesters, but got distracted by a squirrel outside his window.<br/><br/>In other news, the Iranian army has announced that it will be joining security forces in defending public property, including government buildings and the occasional Taco Bell. When asked about this development, an Iranian military spokesperson explained that they were simply "trying to protect the nation's frozen yogurt supplies."<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, world leaders are calling for calm and restraint from both protesters and security forces. The EU chief has condemned the "violent repression" against demonstrators, while the UN spokesman has expressed his "disturbance" at the loss of life. In a bizarre press conference, French President Emmanuel Macron was seen sipping espresso and reading Le Monde while responding to questions about the situation.<br/><br/>In related news, the Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has released a statement saying "the protesters are vandals trying to please Trump". When asked for clarification, an Iranian government spokesperson explained that this was simply a "typical Friday night rant".<br/><br/>UPDATE: Reports are emerging of a group of hipsters in Tehran who are protesting the lack of artisanal coffee shops in the city. Witnesses claim that they were spotted sipping pour-overs and discussing the merits of various types of cheese while being chased by security forces.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
