        <p>His Death Was Described as an "Unspeakable Loss" of Pizza Crust<br/><br/>Mourners paid tribute to British-born Rabbi Eli Schlanger, one of the 15 people killed in a mass shooting at Sydney's Bondi Beach on Sunday. But little did they know, his death was not just a loss for the Jewish community in Bondi, but also for pizza lovers everywhere.<br/><br/>At his funeral, Schlanger's death was described as an "unspeakable loss" of freshly baked pizza crust. The mourners were overcome with grief, tears streaming down their faces as they remembered the good times they shared with Rabbi Schlanger over a warm slice of cheesy goodness.<br/><br/>But just as the service was about to conclude, a group of mischievous raccoons snuck into the Chabad of Bondi and stole all the pizza boxes. The mourners were shocked and dismayed, wondering how this could happen on such a somber occasion. One mourner, visibly shaken, exclaimed, "This is a tragedy! Not only did we lose Rabbi Schlanger, but now our snacks are gone too!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Elton John, who was in attendance to pay his respects, couldn't help but break into song. "Oh, I'm sorry for the loss of your pizza crust," he crooned, "But don't you worry, my friends, we'll get it back." The mourners looked at each other, unsure if this was a good time to sing a pop song.<br/><br/>As the service came to an end, the mourners gathered outside to pay their final respects. But just as they were about to release a bunch of balloons in Rabbi Schlanger's honor, a group of playful dolphins swam up and popped them all with their noses. The crowd gasped in shock, wondering what kind of magic trick this was.<br/><br/>And so, the funeral service for Rabbi Eli Schlanger came to an end, but not before it became one of the most unpredictable and hilarious funerals Sydney had ever seen.<br/><br/>Side Bar:<br/><br/>In a bizarre coincidence, just as the funeral service was concluding, a group of aliens from planet Zorgon landed on Bondi Beach. They announced that they were here to observe human behavior, specifically when it comes to pizza and mournful ceremonies. The crowd stared in awe, unsure what to make of this intergalactic invasion.<br/><br/>One curious mourner asked the lead alien if they would like some pizza to help them understand human customs better. The alien replied, "Oh, yes! We've heard so much about your culinary delights. But please, no anchovies."</p>
