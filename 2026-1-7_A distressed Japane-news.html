        <p>BREAKING: Japanese Nuclear Agency Employee Loses Phone, May Have Leaked Sensitive Info... or Not<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, an employee from Japan's nuclear safety agency has lost his work phone at the Shanghai airport. The phone, which contained confidential contact details of staff involved in nuclear security work, has been MIA since November 3rd. But don't worry, authorities are on it!<br/><br/>Or so we thought.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation (aka a bunch of dudes in white lab coats who smell like radiation), the data might have been leaked, but maybe not. It's all pretty murky at this point. Like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and riding a unicorn.<br/><br/>The NRA employee, who remains unnamed because, you know, his reputation is still intact (ha!), was on a personal trip when he lost the phone. Whoops! He noticed it was missing three days later and... well, that's about as far as we get with this story. He checked with the airport, but they just shrugged and said, "Dude, you probably left it in the Starbucks line."<br/><br/>This incident comes at a time when Japan is trying to revive its atomic energy program, which has been stalled for more than a decade (aka since everyone's grandma got sick from radiation poisoning). The NRA was formed after Fukushima to oversee nuclear safety, because clearly, one meltdown wasn't enough.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in unrelated news, the employee who lost the phone might have left it at the bar with a bunch of strippers and a plate of fried calamari. We can't confirm this, but it wouldn't be surprising given Japan's history of nuclear-related incidents (see also: "That One Time").<br/><br/>To add some more flair to this story, we can mention that Chubu Electric Power, another Japanese nuclear plant operator, might have used cherry-picked data during safety screenings for its nuclear plant. Like when you pick the ripest cherries from a tree and throw away the rest (except in this case, it's nuclear safety).<br/><br/>In conclusion, an employee lost a phone with sensitive info at Shanghai airport, but probably not really because who keeps track of that stuff? It's like trying to follow a Twitter thread about pineapple pizza.</p>
