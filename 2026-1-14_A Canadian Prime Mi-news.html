        <p>BREAKING: PM Carney's China Visit Hits a Few Bumps - Literally<br/><br/>Canadian Prime Minister Mark Carney's highly anticipated visit to China has taken an unexpected turn, with the prime minister getting stuck in a revolving door for several minutes while trying to enter a high-security facility.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Carney became wedged between two glass panels as he attempted to exit the building, causing a brief delay in his schedule. "I was just about to give him a warm welcome when suddenly he got stuck," said Premier Li Qiang, chuckling. "We had to call in the 'Door Whisperer' from Beijing to set him free."<br/><br/>Despite this minor mishap, Carney and Chinese President Xi Jinping are expected to have a robust discussion on trade, security, and other pressing issues between the two nations.<br/><br/>Trade Tensions Ease - Temporarily<br/><br/>The Canadian government has announced that it will be lifting tariffs on Chinese electric vehicles, effective immediately. However, just as quickly, Beijing slapped retaliatory tariffs on Canadian canola exports, citing "frustration expressed by farmers" due to Canada's supposed "blind allegiance" to the United States.<br/><br/>Experts predict a short-lived trade détente between the two nations, with Carney's team assuring the public that they are working diligently to resolve the issue. Meantime, Canadian farmers are bracing themselves for another round of tariffs on their canola exports.<br/><br/>A Sudden Appearance by the Prime Minister's Secret Love<br/><br/>During a brief lull in talks between Carney and Xi Jinping, an unexpected figure emerged from behind a screen: none other than the prime minister's secret love interest, a former pop star named "Lola LaLaLa."<br/><br/>Dressed in a stunning silk kimono and sporting a hairdo that defied gravity, Lola suddenly appeared before the world press corps and began singing a rendition of her hit single, "Can't Get Enough." Carney was visibly embarrassed but somehow managed to keep his composure while simultaneously trying to extricate himself from the revolving door.<br/><br/>US Observes with Bemusement<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Washington, US officials are watching Canada's China visit with great interest - and more than a pinch of amusement. "We're not sure what to make of this whole situation," said one senior State Department official. "One minute they're stuck in a revolving door; the next, they're singing with their secret love interest... We're keeping a safe distance, just to see how it all plays out."<br/><br/>As Carney continues his journey through China, we'll keep you updated on any further developments - or surprises. Stay tuned!</p>
