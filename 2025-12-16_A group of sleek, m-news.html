        <h2>EU's Plan to End Petrol and Diesel Cars by 2035 Just Got Wrecked... Literally!</h2>

        <p>The EU's plan to ban new petrol and diesel car sales by 2035 has been derailed by carmakers' lobbying efforts, allowing a whopping 10% of new cars to still be conventional.</p>

        <p>EU's Plan to End Petrol and Diesel Car Sales by 2035 Derailed by Carmakers' Lobbying Efforts<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the European Commission has caved in to pressure from carmakers, particularly in Germany, and watered down its plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel vehicles by 2035. It's like trying to get a cat to take a bath - it just won't happen!<br/><br/>Under the revised plan, only 90% of new cars sold from 2035 will have to be zero-emission, leaving a whopping 10% for conventional petrol or diesel cars, along with hybrids. It's like giving a kid a cookie and saying, "But only if you eat your broccoli first." Who needs that kind of guilt trip?<br/><br/>The European Commission's move is being seen as a victory for carmakers, who have been lobbying heavily to get concessions on the planned rules. It's like trying to get the government to give everyone a free iPhone - it just ain't gonna happen!<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The European Commission has also decided that low-carbon steel made in the EU will be used in vehicles produced by carmakers. Because, you know, that's exactly what we need - more bureaucracy and red tape to slow down our already sluggish economy!<br/><br/>And if all that wasn't enough, the Commission is also encouraging the use of biofuels and e-fuels, which are synthesised from captured carbon dioxide. Sounds like something out of a science fiction movie, right? "Hello, I'm a car driver, but my fuel is made from magic!" <br/><br/>The green transport group T&E has warned that the UK should not follow the EU's lead by weakening its own plans to phase out the sale of conventional cars under the Zero Emission Vehicles Mandate. Good on them for standing up to the bullies!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, carmakers are rejoicing at the Commission's decision, with ACEA director general Sigrid de Vries saying that "flexibility" for manufacturers is "urgent." Yeah, because nothing says "urgency" like a bunch of fat cats trying to protect their bottom line!<br/><br/>In related news, the Pope has announced plans to make the Vatican's fleet of golf carts electric. Because, you know, saving the planet is all about making the rich and powerful feel good about themselves.<br/><br/>And finally, we have Colin Walker from the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit (ECIU) think tank saying that stable policy would give companies confidence to invest in charging infrastructure and avoid "jeopardising investments." Which is just code for "Please don't rock the boat, guys, or you might get hurt."<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* Ford to Scale Back Electric Vehicle Plans: Because who needs electric cars when you can have gas-guzzling F-150s?<br/>* Tories to Scrap Petrol Car Ban if They Win Next Election: The Conservative Party leader is trying to outdo each other in a game of "Who Can Be the Biggest Hypocrite."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
