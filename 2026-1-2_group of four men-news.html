        <p>BOAT-GATE: A Damning Story of Motor Failure and Slightly Unfortunate Timing<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that left many scratching their heads, four men found themselves dangling off the edge of a 40m (130ft) dam in South Africa after their boat suffered motor failure. Because who needs a functioning motor when you've got gravity and water to play with?<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the men were on a leisurely cruise on the Grootdraai Dam in Mpumalanga when disaster struck. "It was like something out of a bad Bond film," said one witness. "I mean, who doesn't love a good boat chase... towards certain doom?"<br/><br/>The National Sea Rescue Institute (NRSI) arrived at the scene and quickly sprang into action – or rather, they opened the sluice gates on the spillway to stop the boat being swept away by the heavy water flow. It was like a aquatic game of Whac-A-Mole, but with more shouting and less moles.<br/><br/>Miraculously, the men were pulled to safety, reportedly uninjured (although one might argue that they had already suffered some emotional trauma). When asked for comment, the men simply shrugged and said, "Well, at least we got a good story out of it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts are baffled by the motor failure. "It's like they wanted to go over the edge," said one engineer, shaking his head in dismay. "I mean, what was the plan here? A boat-shaped water slide?"<br/><br/>As news of the incident spread, social media users couldn't resist poking fun at the situation. "When you've got a bad day at work and it just gets worse... and then worse again," tweeted one user.<br/><br/>And so, the four men now have a new nickname: The Dammed Four. It's not exactly the most auspicious title to go down in history with, but hey, at least they'll always have a good tale to tell – or rather, a bad joke to repeat at parties.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, a local tourist board has announced plans to launch a new water-based attraction: "Drowning Your Sorrows... and Yourself." It's set to become the next big thing in South African adventure tourism.</p>
