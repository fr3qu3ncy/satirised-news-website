        <p>BREAKING: Israel's Registration Rules Threaten Collapse of Gaza Aid Operations (But Don't Worry, the Pizza Delivery Guys Will Still Get Through)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Israeli government has announced that all international non-governmental organisations (INGOs) not registered by December 31st will be forced to close their operations in Israel. But fear not, dear readers, for the aid delivery will still continue – courtesy of the Pizza Delivery Guys, who have been secretly training in the art of humanitarian logistics.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Israeli government, the new registration rules are designed to "weed out" any INGOs that don't conform to Israel's strict standards. These standards include, but are not limited to: a) denying the existence of Israel as a Jewish and democratic state (yawn), b) promoting boycotts of Israel (not exactly what you'd call "tourist-friendly"), and c) calling for the prosecution of Israeli security forces in foreign courts (ouch).<br/><br/>The UN and other aid agencies, on the other hand, are not exactly thrilled about these new rules. In fact, they're warning that the collapse of INGOs' operations will lead to a disaster of epic proportions – think gazes-wide devastation, plus one in three health facilities closing down. It's like, hello, who's gonna deliver all those medical supplies now?!<br/><br/>Save the Children, for one, has already been informed that their registration application was rejected. "We're not ones to shy away from a challenge," said a spokesperson, "but seriously, can someone please explain to us what we did wrong? Oh wait, it's probably just because we support all those pesky Palestinian children."<br/><br/>Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF) is also feeling the heat. Their statement was like a breath of fresh air – or rather, a scream of despair: "Independent and experienced humanitarian organisations losing access to respond would be a disaster for Palestinians." One can almost imagine the MSF team running around Gaza, frantically waving white flags and shouting, "We've got no money, no food, and no way out!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, an Israeli official was quoted as saying that INGOs have had "more than sufficient time" to get their registrations sorted. More than sufficient? Has this guy ever heard of the concept of a "humanitarian emergency"? It's like, we're trying to save lives here, not plan a beach vacation!<br/><br/>And then, of course, there's the small matter of Pizza Delivery Guys' involvement in all this. Sources close to the group claim that they've been training for months on how to deliver medical supplies and pizzas simultaneously – it's like a logistical ninja move, if you will.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks – the story of how Israel's registration rules are about to cause chaos in Gaza, but hey, at least the Pizza Delivery Guys will still be delivering. Now, who's up for some pizza and a side of humanitarian aid?</p>
