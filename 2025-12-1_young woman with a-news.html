        <p>**BREAKING: "Kill Everybody" Gate Scandal Rocks Trump Administration**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US military has been accused of carrying out a second strike on a suspected Venezuelan drug boat, killing survivors who were supposed to be spared. Yes, you read that right - survivors. Because what's a few more dead bodies when you're already in a kill-or-be-killed situation?<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (i.e., a guy I met at a bar), Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth ordered the second strike, saying "Kill everybody on board! And if there are any survivors, just kill them too. Why bother with all that tedious paperwork?" When asked for comment, Hegseth said, "Fake news, folks. I would never say such a thing. Unless... unless I was trying to sound tough in front of the guys at the golf course."<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! The Trump administration is now denying any wrongdoing, with President Donald Trump tweeting out a string of completely unrelated emojis (🐶💕🚀) to distract from the controversy.<br/><br/>In related news, Venezuela's National Assembly has condemned the US for its actions and vowed to carry out an investigation. Meanwhile, President Maduro is rumored to be planning a new line of merchandise featuring his face next to the words "Not My Secretary" (sold separately: "Not My President").<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** The Washington Post has confirmed that Hegseth's assistant is now in hiding after being forced to sign a non-disclosure agreement promising not to reveal any more embarrassing details about the Defense Secretary's love of drone strikes and questionable use of the phrase "Kill everybody."<br/><br/>**FACT CHECK:**<br/><br/>* Yes, it is possible for a US military strike to kill survivors.<br/>* No, we're not making this up. Well, maybe we are, but only because we're trying to keep our sanity in these crazy times.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
