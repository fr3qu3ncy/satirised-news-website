        <h2>INDIA LOST ITS MIND IN 2025: REMAKING EVERY 90S ACTION MOVIE WITH ANGRY MEN, EXPLOSIONS, AND TOKEN WOMEN</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>2025 was the year that India collectively lost its mind, remaking every testosterone-fueled action movie from the 90s with a cast of angry men, explosions, and token women thrown in for good measure.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>THE YEAR ANGRY MEN DOMINATED BOLLYWOOD - AND WHAT IT MEANS FOR INDIA<br/><br/> Ah, 2025: the year of angry men, explosions, and Bollywood films that made you want to scratch your head and wonder what happened to our collective sanity. It's like India took a step back in time, donned a pair of ripped jeans and a "I'm with stupid" t-shirt, and decided to remake every testosterone-fueled action movie from the 90s.<br/><br/>TOP 10 BOX-OFFICE HITS: A TALE OF TWO CINEMAS<br/><br/>The top 10 box-office hits for 2025 read like a who's who of macho men doing what they do best - smashing things, looking good while doing it, and occasionally saving damsels in distress. And yes, I'm including the romantic drama Ek Deewane Ki Deewaniyat, which is basically just an excuse to show off Harshvardhan Rane's abs.<br/><br/>DHURANDHAR: THE BOLLYWOOD BLOCKBUSTER THAT PROVED INDIA HAS A SOFT SPOT FOR ANGRY MEN<br/><br/>Dhurandhar was the biggest hit of 2025, and for good reason - it had everything an Indian audience loves: explosions, guns, more explosions, and a healthy dose of revenge. The film's protagonist, played by Ranveer Singh, is like a male version of Wonder Woman - but instead of saving the world from evil, he just saves himself from boredom.<br/><br/>WOMEN-LED STORIES: THE UNLUCKY OUTLIERS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, one woman-centric film actually made it to the top 10 - Lokah, starring Kalyani Priyadarshan. But don't get too excited, folks; it's not like the film industry has suddenly turned over a new leaf and decided to give women a fair shake. Nope, it was just an outlier, a brief moment of sanity in a sea of testosterone-fueled madness.<br/><br/>STREAMING PLATFORMS: THE NEW WAVE OF TOXIC MASCULINITY<br/><br/>And if you thought Bollywood had gone mad, wait till you see the streaming platforms. According to a report by Ormax, action and crime thrillers now make up 43% of Hindi shows on OTT platforms - that's more than twice the number of female-led stories (12%). It's like India has collectively decided to binge-watch a never-ending loop of male gaze, with just enough token women sprinkled throughout to make us feel better about ourselves.<br/><br/>SO, WHAT'S NEXT FOR BOLLYWOOD?<br/><br/>Well, if history is any guide, we can expect more of the same - angry men, explosions, and an endless parade of macho heroes. But hey, at least we'll have something to talk about while watching the next big Bollywood blockbuster... and possibly a few angry tweets from women's rights activists.</p>
