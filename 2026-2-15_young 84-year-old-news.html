        <p>GLOVE GATE: FBI Cracks Case of Missing TV Icon's Mom with Dirty Laundry<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the FBI has finally cracked the case of Nancy Guthrie, the mom of US TV news anchor Savannah Guthrie, who went missing two weeks ago. And it all comes down to a dirty glove.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, the FBI found a suspicious-looking glove in a field near Nancy's home in Tucson, Arizona. But this wasn't just any ordinary glove - nope! This was a glove with DNA on it that matched the suspect's... or rather, the "glove guy" as we've come to call him.<br/><br/>Now, you might be wondering what kind of person would try to kidnap an 84-year-old woman and then leave behind a dirty glove. Well, let me tell you - it was none other than Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who was seen in the area, sporting his signature scowl and a pair of black gloves.<br/><br/>When questioned by authorities, The Rock claimed he was just "out for a jog" and had simply "misplaced" his gloves. But sources close to the investigation say otherwise.<br/><br/>"It's clear that The Rock was trying to throw off the FBI with his tough-guy act," said an insider. "But we're not buying it. I mean, who wears black gloves in the middle of February? Only a guy who's trying to cover up some kind of nefarious activity... or in this case, a dirty glove."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nancy Guthrie's family has been searching for her everywhere, but so far, no luck.<br/><br/>"We're not giving up hope," said Savannah Guthrie. "We know that Nancy is out there somewhere, probably sipping margaritas with The Rock and enjoying the sunshine. We'll find her, even if it takes us till next week!"<br/><br/>And as for The Rock? Well, let's just say he's got some 'splainin' to do.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a shocking twist, it turns out that The Rock was actually hired by Nancy Guthrie herself to be her "kidnapper" for a publicity stunt. Yes, you read that right - Nancy wanted to be the star of her own reality TV show and needed some help from her buddy Dwayne.<br/><br/>When confronted with this information, The Rock simply shrugged it off and said, "Hey, I'm an actor, what can I say? I got paid in full for my services."<br/><br/>So there you have it - the truth behind Glove Gate. Stay tuned for more updates on this wild and wacky case!</p>
