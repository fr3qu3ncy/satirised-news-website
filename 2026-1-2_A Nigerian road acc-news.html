        <p>ANTHONY JOSHUA'S DRIVER CHARGED OVER NIGERIA CRASH THAT KILLED TWO... AND A PARROT<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Anthony Joshua's driver, Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode, has been charged with causing death by dangerous driving after a crash in Nigeria that killed two of the boxer's team members and injured Joshua. But here's the kicker: a parrot was also on the scene, and witnesses claim it was seen flying around the wreckage, squawking "Good show, old chap!"<br/><br/>According to police sources, Kayode, 46, was driving a Lexus SUV that collided with a parked truck on the Lagos-Ibadan expressway. Joshua, 36, was a passenger in the vehicle, along with his personal trainer, Latif Ayodele, and strength coach, Sina Ghami, who sadly lost their lives in the crash.<br/><br/>But what really happened at the scene of the crime? Well, eyewitnesses claim that Kayode was seen arguing with a group of street vendors over a disputed bag of fries just minutes before the accident. "I was walking down the road when I saw Adeniyi yelling at those fry sellers," said one witness. "He was like, 'You're not getting away with my fries, you scoundrels!' and then... well, you know."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Joshua has been left "heavy-hearted" over the loss of his friends, but is reportedly feeling better after a good night's sleep and a hearty breakfast of beans on toast. "I'm just glad I didn't have to fight any pirates on my way to hospital," he tweeted.<br/><br/>And in other news, the parrot that was spotted at the scene of the crash has been identified as a 3-year-old African Grey named Mr. Whiskers. When asked about his role in the drama, Mr. Whiskers simply squawked "Polly wants a cracker" and flew away.<br/><br/>UPDATE: It's been reported that Kayode is now facing additional charges for "reckless and negligent driving," as well as "driving without due care." Oh, and also for being seen with a woman who was not his wife. The plot thickens!<br/><br/>PHOTO CAPTION: Anthony Joshua (center) looks on in shock as his driver, Adeniyi Mobolaji Kayode (left), is led away by police officers while a parrot perched on the shoulder of a street vendor (right) looks on with interest.<br/><br/>LATEST TWITTER UPDATE FROM ANTHONY JOSHUA: "Just had the most ridiculous breakfast of my life. Beans on toast, anyone? #ParrotGate #DriverDrama"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this wacky story!</p>
