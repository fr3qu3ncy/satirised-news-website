        <p>BREAKING: His Popular Forces group says Abu Shabab was shot while attempting to resolve a family dispute and not killed by Hamas (or by my aunt who's always trying to get rid of me)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Yasser Abu Shabab, the leader of the so-called "Popular Forces" militia in Gaza, has been shot. Yes, you read that right - SHOT! Not killed by Hamas, not taken out by an IS drone (although, let's be real, those guys are always on the lookout for someone to take out), but simply SHOT while attempting to resolve a family dispute. Specifically, he was trying to mediate between the Abu Seneima family members who couldn't agree on whose turn it was to do the dishes.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Popular Forces (which we can assume means "people who just really love doing press releases"), Abu Shabab was shot in the... um... let's just say "lower extremities" while trying to break up a heated argument between two cousins over whose favorite TV show is better, "The Great British Baking Show" or "Jersey Shore".<br/><br/>When asked for comment, a Hamas spokesperson simply shrugged and said, "Look, we didn't kill him. If you want to know who did, ask the guy who's always leaving his dirty socks on the floor - that's who."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, an Israeli military source was quoted as saying, "We're not sure what happened to Abu Shabab, but we do know one thing: if he had just stayed out of it, none of this would have happened. Like when you try to mediate a dispute between two roommates over whose turn it is to take the last slice of pizza."<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a bizarre twist, it's been reported that Abu Shabab's body was found in a closet at his home, surrounded by stacks of unpaid bills and old copies of "Playboy" magazine. When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Popular Forces simply said, "Well, he did always say he wanted to be buried with his Xbox controller... guess we just gave it to him."<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: in Gaza, you can't even get a decent cup of coffee without someone trying to kill you. Just ask Suthisak Rintalak, that Thai hostage who was finally returned by Hamas after being held for months - he's still shaking his head over the whole ordeal.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story... or just go watch some cat videos online, trust me.</p>
