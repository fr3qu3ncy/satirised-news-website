    <div class="article">
        <p>"TRUMP TALKS DOWN MILITARY DRILLS WITH A SMILE, BUT KIM JONG UN IS LIKE 'WAIT, WHAT'S GOING ON HERE?'"<br/><br/>The US President has downplayed the drills which follow a US announcement of an $11bn arms sale to Taiwan, but somehow we're all worried about what Kim Jong Un's cat, Mr. Whiskers, is thinking about it.<br/><br/>Trump shrugged off the drills which come nearly two weeks after the US announced one of its largest-ever arms sales to Taiwan, saying "I'm not worried, I've got a great relationship with President Xi... and he hasn't told me anything about these drills." Little did Trump know that Mr. Whiskers was secretly running a betting pool on how long it would take for China to get their military ready.<br/><br/>"No, nothing worries me," Trump said of the drills, which have ramped up in recent years and now include simulating a blockade of the island. "They've been doing naval exercises for 20 years in that area... I'm pretty sure my goldfish could handle it." We're not sure what's more surprising, Trump's confidence or the fact that his goldfish has its own social media account.<br/><br/>The drills, which began on Monday, take place nearly two weeks after the US announced one of its largest-ever arms sales to Taiwan. And by "arms sale," we mean that America just dumped a bunch of fancy military toys in Taiwan's backyard and now China is all like "Hey, I want those!"<br/><br/>Taiwan's defence ministry said it detected 130 Chinese military aircraft around the island on Tuesday morning, 90 of which crossed the "median line" - an unofficial border dividing China and Taiwan. Meanwhile, Mr. Whiskers was just chillin', thinking about his next catnip purchase.<br/><br/>The Taiwanese ministry said on Tuesday that it had spotted more than a dozen Chinese navy vessels near the island. But don't worry, they're probably just there for a naval parade... with tanks... and missile launchers.<br/><br/>Taiwan's presidential office has criticised the drills, calling them a challenge to international norms. In a Tuesday morning statement on social media, President Lai Ching-te said the Chinese Communist Party's escalation of military pressure was "not something that a responsible power should do." We're pretty sure Mr. Whiskers would agree with that.<br/><br/>Susan Shirk, former US Deputy Assistant Secretary of State, told the BBC that this week's drills are actually for Donald Trump and Japan more than the people of Taiwan. And if you thought that was surprising, get ready for this: Alexander Neill, an adjunct fellow with the Pacific Forum, says that "if [Trump] is suggesting that his rapport with Xi Jinping will have any bearing on Xi's approach to the Taiwan Strait, I think he's deluding himself." Yeah, because that's exactly what Trump does.<br/><br/>China has long vowed to "reunify" with Taiwan and has not ruled out the use of force to take it. It has in recent years ramped up pressure over Taipei with military drills and regular incursions into its waters and airspace. Meanwhile, Mr. Whiskers is just trying to figure out how he's going to get his paws on some of those fancy new missiles.<br/><br/>Taiwan in turn has plans to boost defence spending to modernise its armed forces... or so we thought until we found out that their actual plan was to open a chain of bubble tea shops around the island.</p>
