        <p>BREAKING: Colombian Cocaine Gang Declared Terrorist Group, Trump Promises Land Strikes Against Narco-Terrorists<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the United States has designated the notorious Colombian cocaine-trafficking organisation Clan del Golfo as a terrorist group. The decision was made just hours after President Donald Trump signed an executive order classifying fentanyl as a "weapon of mass destruction." This escalation in the war on drugs is expected to bring the full weight of US law enforcement down on the group.<br/><br/>But what really caught our attention was the surprise appearance of Colonel Klink from Hogan's Heroes, who emerged from nowhere to sign the executive order. Sources close to the Trump administration confirmed that Colonel Klink was brought in for his expertise in dealing with "rogue" groups. When asked about the sudden arrival of the mustachioed colonel, a White House spokesperson simply said, "Hey, if it works, why fix it?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Clan del Golfo has issued a statement promising to continue their work as they always have: smuggling cocaine and migrants through the Darién Gap. In a brazen move, they've even offered a special discount for bulk orders of fentanyl. When asked about this development, Trump simply shrugged and said, "Hey, if they want to make America great again by selling drugs, that's their business."<br/><br/>But not everyone is happy with the new designation. Colombian President Gustavo Petro has denounced the move as an attempt to undermine his efforts to bring peace to the country through talks with the Clan del Golfo. When asked about Trump's claims that he's a "lunatic," Petro simply shook his head and said, "I'm not the one who wears a pair of plaid pants with a bright orange shirt."<br/><br/>As tensions rise in the region, Trump has promised to take the fight against narco-terrorists to land. Sources close to the administration have hinted that this might involve a special forces team led by none other than Chuck Norris himself. When asked about this development, Norris simply grinned and said, "I've got a license to kill, and I'm not afraid to use it."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, including an exclusive interview with the CEO of Frito-Lay, who's been quietly building a cocaine-sniffing robot to help with the fentanyl-finding efforts.</p>
