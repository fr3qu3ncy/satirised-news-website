        <p>BREAKING: Cilia Flores, Venezuelan First Lady, Arrested by US Forces for Corruption, Nepotism, and Cocaine Smuggling<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US forces have arrested Cilia Flores, the 69-year-old wife of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro, on charges of corruption, nepotism, and cocaine smuggling. Yes, you read that right - the First Lady was caught trying to smuggle cocaine into the US.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (or not so close, who knows?), Flores was taken by surprise during a midnight raid at her compound in Caracas. She reportedly tried to bribe her way out of the situation, but alas, her "First Warrior" charm didn't quite work on the US authorities.<br/><br/>As it turns out, Flores has been accused of accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes from a large-scale drug trafficker (because that's not a thing) and arranging meetings with government officials to further her family's... um, interests. Yeah, that's it.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Her nephews, Francisco and Efrain Antonio Campo Flores, were arrested in Haiti for trying to smuggle 800kg of cocaine into the US back in 2015 (nice try, guys). They got sentenced to 18 years in prison, but were later released as part of a prisoner swap with the Biden administration. However, the Trump administration had other plans, and slapped fresh sanctions on them last month.<br/><br/>Flores will now face charges in a New York court alongside her husband, who was also arrested during the raid (because why not?). It's rumored that they'll be sharing a cell with their nephews, because family is everything, right?<br/><br/>In related news, Nicolas Maduro's campaign slogan has been changed from "First Warrior" to "Also Arrested."</p>
