        <p>US Envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's adviser and son-in-law Jared Kushner are about to meet Vladimir Putin on Tuesday, because apparently the world needs more people in a room with bad haircuts and questionable fashion choices.

The meeting is part of a grand effort to end the war in Ukraine, or as some might call it, "the latest iteration of a never-ending game of geopolitical Risk". Zelensky's top aide just got fired, which is roughly equivalent to saying that Putin's ego has been sufficiently bruised, and now we're supposed to believe that this will actually lead to peace. How original.

Meanwhile, Macron is trying to broker some kind of deal, but let's be real, it's like trying to negotiate a divorce with your ex while simultaneously being forced to listen to their Top 40 playlist on repeat. The territorial issue is the most difficult, mainly because Putin has a tendency to use words like "difficult" when really he means "I'm not giving up my beloved Russian territory without a fight".

The US-Russia draft peace plan was leaked, and what did we get? A whole lot of nothing, except for some vague promises that everyone's favorite authoritarian leader made. I mean, who needs actual details when you can just have a nice photo op with Putin?

So, there you have it: Witkoff, Kushner, and Putin will be sitting around sipping tea and pretending to care about Ukraine's sovereignty while secretly plotting their next move in the world of international relations. And we're all just along for the ride, trying not to take ourselves too seriously.

Oh, and one more thing: the White House is feeling "very optimistic" about a deal being reached, mainly because they've been drinking too much coffee and eating too many donuts.</p>
