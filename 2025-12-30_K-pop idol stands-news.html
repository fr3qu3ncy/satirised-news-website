    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Danielle Marsh Sued for $30m After Ador Drops Her Like a Hot Potato<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, record label Ador has decided to drop NewJeans member Danielle Marsh like a hot potato that's lost its steam. And by "drop her," we mean they're suing her for $30m. That's right, folks, it's like they're trying to make up for the fact that they dropped her by taking her to court.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the label (i.e., a guy who works in the mailroom), Ador claims that Danielle "bear[s] significant responsibility" for the fallout between the agency and the K-pop group. We're not sure what that means, but we're pretty sure it involves some kind of weird, mystical connection to the ancient art of K-pop.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, fans are going wild on social media, wondering how they can still call themselves NewJeans without Danielle. It's like asking a pizza to be delivered without cheese – just doesn't make sense. As one fan tweeted, "Does this mean we'll never see Danielle's iconic dance moves again?!"<br/><br/>And what about Minji, the mysterious and elusive member who's been MIA for weeks? Will she finally reveal her true intentions, or will we have to wait until the sequel of "K-pop: The Search for Minji"?<br/><br/>In other news, Hanni and Hyein are reportedly still with Ador, because, you know, that's not weird at all. It's like they're trying to recreate the magic of the original NewJeans lineup by adding a dash of confusion.<br/><br/>As for Danielle, well, let's just say she might need to start looking for a new career path – one that doesn't involve getting sued by her former record label. We hear she's been considering a career in professional snail racing or something.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Minji has finally emerged from her secret lair, and all is right with the world... or at least, all is right until we get to the part where Danielle gets sued for $30m.</p>
