        <p>BREAKING: TEENAGERS MISSING AFTER SKI RESORT BAR FIRE - BUT WHERE ARE THEY HIDING?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, families are frantically searching for their missing teenagers after a fire ripped through a bar in a Swiss ski resort. But here's the thing - these kids were last seen wearing silly hats and pretending to be adults, so it's anyone's guess where they actually are.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was just a guy with a selfie stick), the bar, Le Constellation, was packed with teenagers on New Year's Eve. But when the fire started, they all suddenly developed superhuman speed and agility, allowing them to escape through a tiny window while simultaneously doing backflips off the bar.<br/><br/>One of the missing teens, Arthur Brodard, 16, was last seen arguing with his mom over whose turn it was to do the dishes. His mom, Laetitia, is now on a mission to find him, but she's having trouble because all the hospitals in Switzerland are closed for a surprise Christmas-themed party.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Emanuele Galeppini, another 16-year-old junior golfer, was last heard from when he said "I'm going to go get some pizza" and promptly disappeared into thin air. His dad is devastated, but at least he got a nice Instagram post out of it.<br/><br/>And then there's Emilie Pralong, 22, who's been reported missing by her family because she still hasn't sent them any New Year's resolutions. Her grandfather, Pierre, is worried sick and has taken to broadcasting his anguish on BFMTV.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! Alice Kallergis, a 15-year-old with dual Greek and Swiss nationality, was at the bar with her friends when the fire broke out. But instead of panicking, she suddenly remembered that she had left her homework in her backpack and ran off to finish it before anyone noticed.<br/><br/>As the search continues for these missing teens, officials have announced that they will be using a special new technology to locate them - essentially, it's just a bunch of dudes with walkie-talkies shouting "WHERE'S THE PARTY?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
