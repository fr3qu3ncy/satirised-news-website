        <p>In a shocking turn of events, Alina Habba, Trump's former personal attorney, has been disqualified from serving as US Attorney for New Jersey because she was too busy playing video games and eating Cheetos to actually do the job.

A panel of judges ruled that Habba's actions, which included binge-watching Netflix and taking 47 consecutive hours off to play Fortnite with her friends, were "unlawful" and therefore disqualified her from the position. When asked for comment, Habba stated, "What? No way! I was just on a really good streak in Fortnite!"

But wait, it gets better! It turns out that Trump himself appointed Habba as US Attorney despite having never met her before, and only because he wanted to give her a chance to prove herself. However, when the Senate rejected her nomination, Trump decided to bypass the whole process and just install her anyway.

The judges found this tactic to be "utterly ridiculous" and ruled that it was indeed unlawful. Habba's lawyer responded by saying, "My client is a highly qualified individual with many years of experience in law... or at least, that's what I've been told."

Meanwhile, the White House has issued a statement denying any wrongdoing on Trump's part, claiming that he was simply trying to support his former personal attorney. However, when asked if Habba was actually doing her job as US Attorney, they replied with a resounding "Uh, nope!"

In related news, Lindsey Halligan, another Trump-appointed US Attorney who was previously disqualified for similar reasons, has been replaced by none other than Dolly Parton. Yes, you read that right – Dolly Parton is now the top federal prosecutor in Virginia.

When asked about her new role, Parton replied, "I'm fixin' to get this job done, honey! I've got my trusty tiara and my favorite wig, and I'm ready to take on whatever case comes my way!"

And finally, in a bizarre twist, former FBI Director James Comey has filed an appeal to have his own cases reinstated. When asked why he was doing so, Comey replied, "I just wanted to make sure that my name wasn't associated with the recent string of high-profile prosecutions... mainly because I heard they were having a great taco Tuesday at the office."</p>
