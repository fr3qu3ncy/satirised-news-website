        <p>BREAKING: Hong Kong Man Arrested for Asking Too Many Questions<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Miles Kwan, a university student and avid Pokémon trainer, was detained by authorities in Hong Kong after launching a petition demanding answers from the government following one of the city's deadliest fires. The blaze, which ravaged a densely populated housing estate in Tai Po, killed at least 159 people and displaced thousands.<br/><br/>But here's the thing: Miles wasn't just asking for answers – he was also demanding a refund on his Pokémon Go subscription because he couldn't catch any rare creatures during the fire. Okay, maybe that part isn't true... but still, authorities took issue with his petition.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (aka my friend Jimmy who lives in Hong Kong), Miles was arrested by national security police on suspicion of sedition. He's now out on bail and has been advised to avoid any areas where there might be too many people or too much noise – basically, anywhere in Hong Kong.<br/><br/>Police say they'll handle the situation "according to the law and actual circumstances," which is code for: "we're trying not to make things worse, but also don't want to get sued by the government."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, pro-Beijing authorities are warning against attempts to "exploit" the fire to "endanger national security." Translation: don't even think about asking too many questions or pointing out any obvious wrongdoing.<br/><br/>Hong Kong's Chief Executive, John Lee, says he'll "ensure justice is served" to anyone who tries to sabotage relief efforts. Because, you know, that's exactly what's happening here – a massive fire happens, people die, and the government is more concerned with covering its own tracks than actually helping those affected.<br/><br/>In related news, I've started a petition to get Elton John to perform at the next Hong Kong Olympics. Has anyone signed it yet?</p>
