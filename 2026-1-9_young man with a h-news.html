        <p>BREAKING: Man Accused of Grooming Children for Online Self-Harm Trial Hears "764" Group is Actually a Bunch of Nerds in Mom Jeans<br/><br/>BERLIN, Germany - In a shocking turn of events, a 21-year-old man named Shahriar J has gone on trial in Hamburg, accused of grooming children and teenagers to harm themselves online. But what the authorities didn't tell you was that Shahriar's victims were actually a bunch of angsty teens who just wanted to express their feelings through social media.<br/><br/>Prosecutors claim that Shahriar used the pseudonym White Tiger to target vulnerable kids from Germany, the UK, Canada, and the US. However, sources close to the investigation reveal that Shahriar was actually just trying to get likes on his Instagram account. "I mean, who doesn't love a good cat video?" said one insider.<br/><br/>The alleged crimes took place between 2021 and 2023, with Shahriar accused of coercing kids to perform increasingly violent acts on themselves online. But what the authorities don't want you to know is that these acts were actually just a bunch of Fortnite dance challenges gone wrong.<br/><br/>Shahriar's defense lawyer, Christiane Yüksel, rejected the allegations as "baseless and fabricated." She also pointed out that Shahriar was just trying to get attention from his online friends. "I mean, who hasn't tried to get likes on their YouTube video by doing a 360-degree flip off the roof of their garage?" she said.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the US Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) has released a statement describing the "764" group as an international child exploitation enterprise and a "network of nihilistic violent extremists." But what they didn't tell you was that this network actually consisted of a bunch of 14-year-olds playing Minecraft together.<br/><br/>As for Shahriar, he's facing charges of 204 offenses against more than 30 children and teenagers. But his lawyer says it's all just a big misunderstanding. "My client is innocent until proven guilty," she said. "And even if he is guilty, I'm sure he'll only get community service and have to watch a bunch of educational videos about online safety."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>Related:<br/><br/>* Man Accused of Stealing Pizza from Neighbor's Garage Claims it was Just a "Pizza Heist"<br/>* Local Teen Arrested for Trying to Break World Record for Most Tacos Eaten in One Sitting<br/>* Area Man Caught Masturbating in Public Park Says it Was Just a "Moment of Clarity"</p>
