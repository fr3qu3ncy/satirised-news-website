        <p>BREAKING: Teenager Falls 500 Feet from Mountain, Immediately Becomes a Sailor<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova, a 19-year-old California native and avid sailor, has fallen to his death on Mt. Baldy in Southern California. Witnesses report that Casanova was hiking with a friend when he suddenly jumped off the mountain and started sailing down the slopes.<br/><br/>"I was just there for the views," said a witness who wished to remain anonymous. "Next thing I know, Marcus is sailing past me like he's in a regatta."<br/><br/>The friend, who was hiking with Casanova at the time of the incident, stated that they had been planning to have a sailor-themed snack break on the mountain, but things took an unexpected turn.<br/><br/>"We were going to have some sailor crackers and maybe some fish sticks," said the friend. "But then Marcus just fell off the mountain and started sailing away. I was like, 'Dude, you're not even in the water!'"<br/><br/>Rescue crews were called to the scene, but by the time they arrived, Casanova had sailed himself into oblivion.<br/><br/>"We tried to rescue him," said a spokesperson for the San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department, "but he was already a goner. I mean, who needs a life jacket when you can just sail off a mountain?"<br/><br/>The incident has left authorities scratching their heads and wondering what could have been done to prevent it.<br/><br/>"This is a clear case of sailor-induced mortality," said a leading expert in the field. "We've seen it before – sailors always seem to be drawn to water, even if it's on land."<br/><br/>In related news, the death toll on Mt. Baldy has now reached 15 people this year alone, with several more still missing.<br/><br/>Update: Family Releases Statement<br/><br/>The family of Marcus Alexander Muench Casanova released a statement yesterday, saying they were "destroyed" by his death.<br/><br/>"We are heartbroken that our beloved Marcus didn't survive the hike," said the family in a statement. "He was an avid sailor and outdoorsman, but we had no idea he would try to sail off a mountain."<br/><br/>The family has since announced plans to establish a new sport – "mountain sailing" – which involves hiking up a mountain and then immediately sailing down it.<br/><br/>"It's going to be huge," said a spokesperson for the family. "Just think about it – you can hike up a mountain, get some exercise, and then sail down it like a pro. It's the ultimate sport!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Other News...<br/><br/>* A group of hikers on Mt. Baldy has reported finding a rare species of wild animal – the " Sasquatch-Squirrel".<br/>* The San Bernardino County Sheriff's Department has announced plans to start carrying life jackets on all their rescue missions.<br/>* The US Navy has released a statement saying they are not responsible for Casanova's death, as he was not actually in the water at the time.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
