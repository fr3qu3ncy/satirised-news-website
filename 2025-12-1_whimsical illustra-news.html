        <p>**BREAKING: Trump's Former Lawyer Disqualified from Being US Attorney for New Jersey, But Not Before She Becomes the World's Okayest DJ**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Alina Habba, former personal attorney to Donald Trump and now-disqualified US Attorney for New Jersey, has been disqualified from her role by a US appeals court. But before we get into that, let's talk about something really important: Habba's secret life as the world's okayest DJ.<br/><br/>Sources close to the situation (okay, it was just me making this up) claim that in her free time, Habba moonlights as a club DJ, spinning tracks under the alias "DJ Habbs" at local bars and clubs. Her setlists are allegedly a wild mix of 80s rock ballads and country tunes, with occasional surprise appearances by "Who Let the Dogs Out?" on repeat for an hour straight.<br/><br/>But back to the actual news: the appeals court ruled that Trump's administration unlawfully installed Habba in her role as acting US Attorney for New Jersey. You see, when Trump handpicked Habba for the job, a district court rejected her nomination (no surprise there), so the administration just went ahead and made her an acting US attorney anyway. The appellate judges called foul, citing the Federal Vacancies Reform Act (which, honestly, sounds like something out of a bad law school textbook).<br/><br/>In a related story, sources close to Habba's office claim that she has been using her newfound free time to take up knitting as a hobby. Her specialty? Making miniature Trump hats for her collection.<br/><br/>Judge Michael Fisher, one of the appellate judges, wrote in Monday's ruling disqualifying Habba: "It is apparent that the current administration has been frustrated by some of the legal and political barriers to getting its appointees in place." To which we say: "Duh, no kidding?" I mean, who wouldn't want to install their personal lawyer as a top federal prosecutor? It's not like there are rules against nepotism or anything.<br/><br/>The BBC has contacted Habba's office for comment (although, let's be real, she was probably too busy making DJ mixtapes to respond).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the White House is still trying to figure out how they can fit a DJ booth into the Oval Office.</p>
