        <p>**BREAKING: Trump's Former Attorney, Alina Habba, Kicked Out of New Jersey for Being Too Good (at Being Unlawful)**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Alina Habba, the former personal attorney to Donald Trump and current US Attorney for New Jersey, has been disqualified from serving in her role. And it's not because she was too good at her job... but because she was just plain bad at being lawful.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (i.e., a very reliable inside informant who loves to gossip), Habba had been "handpicked" by Trump for the job, which is code for "he owed her a favor and wanted to get her in trouble." But little did he know, she was already busy being a ninja of injustice, sneaking around New Jersey, and filling out forms with incorrect numbers.<br/><br/>The appeals court, made up of three wise judges who are secretly all Method actors from the 90s, ruled that Habba's appointment was "unlawful" due to her failure to follow proper procedure. In other words, she didn't fill out enough paperwork or wear a fancy suit when meeting with important people.<br/><br/>The judges were so flabbergasted by this revelation that they decided to take drastic measures: disqualifying Habba from serving as US Attorney for New Jersey. This means that all the cases she's been working on will now have to be handled by a new, properly trained and certified attorney... who will probably just mess everything up even worse.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump was spotted in a nearby Starbucks, sipping on a Venti Iced Caramel Macchiato with room for cream (because he's still got that whole "I'm-a-billionaire-but-I-can't-afford-to-buy-actual-coffee" thing going on). When asked about Habba's disqualification, he simply shrugged and said, "Well, what can I say? She was a real wild card. Reminded me of my buddy Lindsey Graham – always up to no good!"<br/><br/>As for Habba herself, she's been spotted applying for her next gig as a professional wrestling ring girl. Sources close to the matter claim that she's got a mean dropkick and a penchant for wearing spandex.<br/><br/>And so, another Trump appointee bites the dust, leaving behind a trail of chaos, incompetence, and poorly filled-out forms.</p>
