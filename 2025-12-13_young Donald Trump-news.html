        <p>Breaking News: Trump's "Historic" Peace Deal for Dr Congo Shatters Like a Glass Slipper at a Disco Party<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the recent Washington Accord was hailed as "historic" by President Donald Trump, but it seems the fighting continues, and we're not just talking about the kind that happens between spouses after a long night at the disco. The M23 rebel group has seized control of the key city of Uvira, leaving everyone wondering what's next for this already complex conflict.<br/><br/>Trump's Response: A Diplomatic Dance with a Twist of Lemon<br/><br/>President Trump took to social media to express his disappointment, saying "What's going on here? I thought we had a deal, folks! It was supposed to be historic, like my hair when I was young!" He then proceeded to sing a quick tune about the importance of peace in Africa, but with lyrics that were a bit too close to home for our taste.<br/><br/>The US Secretary of State Stepping In: A Last-Ditch Effort<br/><br/>US Secretary of State Marco Rubio jumped into action, saying "We're not going to let Rwanda just walk all over us! We'll take action, but not the kind that involves me wearing a fancy suit and dancing with a bunch of Congolese rebels." He then quickly added, "Oh wait, we will do exactly that."<br/><br/>The M23's Newfound Power: A Rebel Without a Cause...or a Haircut<br/><br/>Prof Jason Stearns explained to us that the M23's goal is simple: they want more leverage in negotiations. "It's like when you're trying to get a good deal on a used car, but the salesperson is being super stubborn," he said with a chuckle.<br/><br/>Burundi's Border Closure: A Move That Would Make Even the Most Patient Person Go Crazy<br/><br/>In an attempt to placate Burundi's fears, the M23 said they have "no sights beyond our national borders." We're pretty sure that's just code for "We're not going to invade your country...yet."<br/><br/>The Fall of Uvira: A City in Chaos, Like My Uncle After a Few Too Many Beers<br/><br/>Yale Ford explained that the fall of Uvira would be a major blow to Burundi's already struggling economy. We can only imagine the looks on their faces when they found out they had lost access to eastern DR Congo's resources.<br/><br/>A Peace Deal That's More Like a Wild Goose Chase: The Never-Ending Story<br/><br/>As for the peace talks, it seems everyone is just trying to figure things out as they go along. "It's like trying to herd cats," said one aid worker. "Except the cats are all armed and have very different opinions on what constitutes a 'peaceful' society."<br/><br/>And in Other News...<br/><br/>* The UN has announced plans to hold an emergency meeting to discuss the conflict, but only after they've finished their Christmas party.<br/>* A team of experts from NASA has been deployed to DR Congo to study the effects of war on local wildlife. They're still trying to figure out why there are so many elephants running around with tiny little guns.<br/>* The Congolese government has announced a new national holiday: "International Day of Not Knowing What to Do." It's scheduled for next Tuesday.<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! This is one wild ride...</p>
