        <p>TRUMP TRIPS OVER HIS OWN FEET (AGAIN), A FAKE VIDEO OF HIM DANCING THE MACARENA, AND 10 POSSIBLE CO-CONSPIRATORS IN EPSTEIN GATE: TAKEAWAYS FROM NEW EPSTEIN FILES<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the largest release of Epstein-related documents yet from the Justice Department has revealed some rather...interesting information. It appears that Donald Trump's name is all over these new files, but not in a good way (what's new?). The DoJ has released over 11,000 documents, with many redactions, because who doesn't love a good game of "spot the censored name"?<br/><br/>One email stands out, sent by someone named "A" from an address that can only be described as "totally not suspicious". This person, who claims to be at Balmoral Summer Camp (the one for royals, duh!), asks Ghislaine Maxwell if she's found them some new "inappropriate friends". Because what's a summer camp without a little bit of underage sex trafficking, am I right?<br/><br/>Maxwell, being the good sport that she is, responds by saying sorry to disappoint, but she's only found friends who are totally appropriate (wink-wink, nudge-nudge). This email has sparked quite the reaction online, with many people wondering why "A" couldn't just get a group chat going on WhatsApp like normal people.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Andrew Mountbatten-Windsor, Duke of York, is still trying to shake off the Epstein scandal. He's lost his title (good riddance), but still claims he had nothing to do with Epstein's crimes. I mean, who needs friends when you've got a reputation to uphold, right?<br/><br/>The FBI has also released some emails that mention 10 possible co-conspirators of Epstein's crimes. Because what's a party without a few co-conspirators, am I right? These names are still mostly redacted, because who wants to ruin reputations (cough), but we do know that Ghislaine Maxwell and Les Wexner are among them.<br/><br/>Lawmakers are up in arms about the level of redactions, saying it's like trying to read a novel with all the pages torn out. The DoJ says they're only protecting the names of victims or people who might be embarrassed by their association with Epstein (i.e., everyone).<br/><br/>In other news, a fake letter from Epstein to Larry Nassar has been released, and let me tell you, it's quite the doozy. Apparently, Epstein took the "short route" home, but I'm pretty sure that's just code for "he got caught".<br/><br/>And finally, we have a video of Donald Trump dancing the Macarena in his bedroom (don't worry, it's not as disturbing as it sounds). It's like he's trying to distract us from all these Epstein files. Newsflash, Donnie: it won't work.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. Just another day in the world of Epstein-related news. Stay tuned for more updates on this never-ending saga!</p>
