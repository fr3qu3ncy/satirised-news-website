        <p>BREAKING: US Coast Guard Searches for Survivors of Another Boat Strike, Because Who Needs a Beach Vacation Anyway?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US Coast Guard has announced that they are searching for survivors of another boat strike that happened just a day after their previous one. Because who needs personal space and sanity when you can have a good old-fashioned game of "boat-whack" in international waters?<br/><br/>According to sources, the US military struck two boats they allegedly thought were carrying drugs on Wednesday, killing five people on board. But let's be real, it's not like they actually found any evidence or anything. It's just a wild guess based on some fancy intelligence stuff that probably involves a lot of cat pictures and memes.<br/><br/>The strike came as a surprise to no one, especially since the US military has been targeting vessels they suspect of smuggling narcotics through the Caribbean and eastern Pacific for the past three months. I mean, who needs a beach vacation when you can spend your days blowing up boats with Donald Trump's face on them?<br/><br/>Wednesday's strike was the 30th in a series of boat-whacks carried out by the US military as part of their "war on drugs" campaign. Because what could possibly go wrong with a war on a substance that people have been using for thousands of years? I mean, it's not like they're just trying to distract us from their own scandals and incompetence or anything.<br/><br/>The Trump administration has proudly declared this operation as a non-international armed conflict with the alleged traffickers. Yeah, because who needs actual laws and regulations when you can just make up your own rules and call them "non-international"? It's like they're playing some kind of twisted game of " Sims" where they get to create their own reality and everyone else has to follow along.<br/><br/>As for the survivors of the previous strike, well, let's just say that it's a good thing there were only two people clinging to the hull of their boat when it got hit again. I mean, can you imagine if there were, like, 20 people on board or something? The US military would have had to send in a team of highly trained dolphin-operators to rescue them all.<br/><br/>In conclusion, the US Coast Guard's search for survivors is just another exciting installment in the thrilling series of "boat-whack"-y goodness that we've come to expect from our government. So grab some popcorn, sit back, and enjoy the show!</p>
