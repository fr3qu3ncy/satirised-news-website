        <p>FARMERS RIOT IN FRENCH COUNTRYSIDE, DEMANDING JUSTICE FOR Slaughtered Cow-Herd<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, French farmers have taken to the streets, armed with pitchforks and protest signs, to demand justice for their slaughtered cow-herd. The cows, accused of having "lumpy skin disease" (LSD), were culled by government-backed vets in what the farmers claim was an unfair and unnecessary slaughter.<br/><br/>Chaos Erupts as Farmers Clash with Riot Police<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report that clashes between riot police and protesters have been erupting across the country. The protesters, many of whom are dressed in their finest "I'm with stupid" t-shirts, are demanding a rethink on the government's policy of slaughtering entire herds where a single animal has been infected.<br/><br/>Tour de France Route Changed Due to Diseased Cows<br/><br/>As it happens, the cows were so diseased that they forced the Tour de France cycle race to cut short one of its stages. "It was like riding through a war zone," said one rider. "The cows were everywhere! We had to take detours just to avoid them."<br/><br/>Elvis Presley's Ghost Appears at Protest<br/><br/>In an unexpected twist, Elvis Presley's ghost appeared at the protest rally in Ariège department. Witnesses claim that the King's spectral figure waved a guitar and shouted "Thank ya, thank ya very much!" as he rode by on horseback.<br/><br/>Donald Trump Offers to Help Farmers<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has offered his services to help the farmers negotiate with the government. "I know all about great deals, folks," said Trump. "And I'll tell you what - we're going to make farming so great in France that you won't even believe it!"<br/><br/>Farmers Call for French Blockade<br/><br/>In a shocking move, the farmers have called for a full-blown blockade of France until their demands are met. "We want justice for our slaughtered cows!" shouted one protester. "And we're not leaving until we get it!"<br/><br/>Lumpy Skin Disease Becomes the New Mumps<br/><br/>As it turns out, Lumpy Skin Disease has become so widespread that it's now being referred to as the new Mumps. "It's like a French version of the Mumps," said a veterinarian. "But instead of getting lumpy skin, you get lumpy cows!"<br/><br/>EU Leaders Scramble for Solution<br/><br/>In Brussels, EU leaders are scrambling to find a solution to the crisis. "We're doing our best to sort out this mess," said one official. "But honestly, we've never had a problem like this before - cows with lumpy skin? It's a first!"<br/><br/>Farmers Promise to Slaughter Pigs Next<br/><br/>As tensions continue to rise, farmers have warned that they'll slaughter the entire pig population if their demands aren't met. "We're not afraid of a little bloodshed," said one farmer. "After all, we've got our priorities straight - pigs are next!"<br/><br/>French Farmers Demand More Cheese<br/><br/>Finally, French farmers have demanded more cheese as part of their settlement with the government. "We need more cheese to fuel our protests," said a spokesperson for the farmers' union. "And we're not leaving until we get it!"</p>
