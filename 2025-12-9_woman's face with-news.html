        <p>Breaking News: French Frenzy Erupts Over "Stupid Bitches" Gate<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the usually tranquil streets of Paris have been disrupted by an unprecedented outpouring of outrage and indignation over First Lady Brigitte Macron's use of the term "stupid bitches" to describe activists who interrupted comedian Ary Abittan's show. The incident has sparked a maelstrom of controversy, with celebrities and feminists taking to social media to express their shock, horror, and utter bewilderment at Mrs. Macron's choice of words.<br/><br/>Activists Wear Ary-Abittan-Masks to Protest Show<br/><br/>In a bold move, a group of activists donned masks resembling the comedian Ary Abittan, shouted "Abittan rapist!" and proceeded to interrupt his stand-up show on Saturday night. The protesters were met with fierce resistance from Mrs. Macron, who was in attendance with her daughter. Witnesses claim that she threatened to kick the protesters out, saying, "If there are any stupid bitches we'll kick them out." Witnesses also reported seeing Mrs. Macron laughing maniacally as she uttered these fateful words.<br/><br/>Celebrities Rally Behind Activists<br/><br/>In a stunning display of solidarity, several celebrities have come forward to support the activists and denounce Mrs. Macron's language. "I too am a stupid bitch," tweeted actor Judith Godrèche, who has herself accused a film director of historical rape (which he denies). Comedian Florence Mendez proudly declared herself a "stupid bitch" on social media, while singer Nadège Beausson-Diagne posted an Instagram message saying she was "proud to be a stupid bitch in summer, winter, spring and autumn." Actor Rachida Brakni thanked the "bitches" for their courage and tagged Nous Toutes (a French organization fighting against violence towards women) in her post.<br/><br/>Stand-up Comedian Marine Leonardi Weighs In<br/><br/>In a biting commentary on Mrs. Macron's language, stand-up comedian Marine Leonardi quipped, "Feminists are never stupid bitches." When asked for comment, Mr. Abittan simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least I'm not a 'sales conne' anymore!"<br/><br/>Watergate-Style Crisis Unfolds<br/><br/>As the scandal deepens, President Macron has been forced to issue a statement distancing himself from his wife's comments. In a last-ditch effort to salvage his reputation, he announced that France would be hosting an emergency summit on Women's Rights, featuring special guest speaker Dolly Parton.<br/><br/>And in Other News...<br/><br/>* The Louvre Museum reported another water leak, this time affecting hundreds of priceless books.<br/>* Russia launched a surprise attack on Ukraine, prompting President Macron to call an emergency meeting with Ukrainian, British, and German leaders in London.<br/>* A group of French teens drowned after their car crashed upside down in a swimming pool.</p>
