        <p>Two men who attempted to carry out a terrorist attack at Bondi Beach were so alike that they even practiced their shooting skills with a cousin who looked like them, because apparently that's what you do when planning a mass murder.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: BONDI GUNMEN WERE LIKE A BAD CASE OF GAS, THEY PLANNED IT FOR MONTHS AND EVEN PRACTICED THEIR SHOOTING WITH A COUSIN WHO LOOKED JUST LIKE THEM<br/><br/>Sydney, Australia - In a shocking turn of events, police have released documents that prove the Bondi Beach shooters were like two peas in a pod... or rather, two identical twins with a penchant for explosives and firearms training.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, the alleged gunmen, Naveed Akram and his dad Sajid, meticulously planned the attack for months. That's right, folks, these guys were so organized, they even practiced their shooting skills in a countryside location with a cousin who looked eerily like them. It was like they were trying to confuse the police... or just really wanted to practice their aim while wearing matching "I'm with stupid" t-shirts.<br/><br/>The documents reveal that on October 12th, the duo filmed themselves in front of an Islamic State flag, making statements about their motivations for the attack and condemning "the acts of 'Zionists'". Because, you know, nothing says "innocent" like a group of terrorists waving a flag with a bunch of Arabic writing on it.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The police fact sheet also includes CCTV footage of the pair loading long and bulky items (aka shotguns and explosives) into their car at an AirBnB rental in Campsie. Because who doesn't love a good game of "load-the-guns-into-the-car-and-then-drive-to-Bondi" with your dad?<br/><br/>And if that wasn't enough, the documents also mention that the pair visited Bondi Beach two days before the attack for reconnaissance. I mean, who needs a map when you have Google Street View and a pair of identical twins to scope out the area for you?<br/><br/>But what really takes the cake is the revelation that the Akrams had been conducting firearms training in a countryside location with a cousin who looked just like them. I'm pretty sure this is what they mean by "having a twin" in the context of terrorism.<br/><br/>In related news, Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was spotted wearing a "I'm not antisemitic, I swear!" t-shirt at a memorial event attended by tens of thousands of people. When asked for comment, he apologized to Jewish Australians and promised to work every day to protect them from... well, pretty much anything.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, folks!</p>
