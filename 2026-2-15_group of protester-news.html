        <p>BREAKING NEWS: WORLD UNITES AGAINST IRANIAN GOVERNMENT (WITH A TWIST)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets around the world yesterday to protest against the Iranian government. But here's the twist – they weren't all there to protest, some were just there for the free food and entertainment.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the largest rally was held in Toronto, where an estimated 350,000 people showed up to... sing karaoke? That's right, folks! The crowd, which included a surprise appearance by Justin Bieber, sang their hearts out to a rendition of "I Will Survive" with Iranian flags waving in the air.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Munich, Germany, Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of Iran's former leader, gave an impassioned speech to an estimated 250,000 people. Or so we thought. It turns out that most of the crowd was actually there to get a glimpse of the " world's largest pizza" which was being handed out by a team of Italian chefs.<br/><br/>Pahlavi's message of resistance against the Iranian government was largely drowned out by chants of "Free Pizza!" and "Pass me another slice, please!"<br/><br/>In Los Angeles, Pahlavi's daughter Noor addressed the crowd, but her speech was interrupted by a group of protesters who stormed the stage demanding more avocado toast. The BBC's US partner CBS News reported that she was heard saying, "Iranians have never been this close to freeing up themselves from this Islamic regime... and also getting a good deal on their avocado toast."<br/><br/>And in London, a crowd gathered outside Downing Street to protest against the Iranian government. But when asked what they were protesting about, one of the protesters replied, "Oh, we're just here for the free hugs, innit?"<br/><br/>The demonstrations were sparked by calls from Pahlavi for a "global day of action" against the Iranian government. However, it appears that most people just showed up for the free stuff.<br/><br/>As one protester in Tel Aviv said, "We didn't know what we were protesting about, but we heard there was going to be a lot of free falafel."<br/><br/>The Iranian government has acknowledged that at least 3,000 people were killed during recent protests in the country. However, they claim some of these deaths were caused by... wait for it... zombies.<br/><br/>Yes, you read that right – zombies! The government claims that an outbreak of zombie-like creatures occurred during the protests, causing chaos and destruction throughout the cities.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, Pahlavi replied, "Well, we didn't know about the zombies either, but we're sure they were just trying to join in on the protest."<br/><br/>And so, the world continues to unite against the Iranian government... or at least, that's what it seems like. In reality, most people are just there for the free food and entertainment.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The United Nations has issued a statement saying that they're not sure what's going on either.</p>
