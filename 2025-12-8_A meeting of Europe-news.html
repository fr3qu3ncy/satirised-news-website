        <p>BREAKING: European Leaders Get Together for Epic Meeting, Putin Shows Up Uninvited with a Bunch of Corgis<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Volodymyr Zelensky and the leaders of France, Germany, and the UK got together in London to discuss the latest US efforts to end the war in Ukraine. But things took a turn for the absurd when Vladimir Putin showed up uninvited with a group of corgis dressed as superheroes.<br/><br/>"We were just trying to have a serious meeting about the peace plan," said Zelensky, "but then suddenly there were these tiny dogs in capes running around and everyone was distracted."<br/><br/>The meeting began with a heated discussion about the security guarantees for Ukraine. "We can't just give away our sovereignty like that," said Macron, while Starmer added, "We need to make sure Russia doesn't get too comfortable."<br/><br/>Just then, Putin burst into the room with his entourage of corgis, each one wearing a tiny superhero cape and mask. "I'm here to save the day!" he exclaimed, as the dogs began to chase each other around the conference table.<br/><br/>The leaders were taken aback by the sudden interruption, but Merz tried to stay calm. "Uh, I think we can still discuss this," he said, while attempting to fend off one of the corgis with a folder.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump, who was watching from a nearby café, couldn't resist chiming in on Twitter: "Just saw Putin's corgi squad show up at the meeting! That guy knows how to make an entrance #MakeUkraineGreatAgain"<br/><br/>As the meeting continued, things only got more bizarre. Zelensky started singing a Ukrainian folk song, while Macron began doing a rendition of the Macarena with the corgis. The room quickly descended into chaos.<br/><br/>In the end, the leaders managed to get back on track and discuss the peace plan, but not before Putin declared that he was going to take over the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant and use it as his own personal playground.<br/><br/>"We can't let him do that," said Starmer, while trying to corral one of the corgis. "We have to protect our nuclear power plants at all costs."<br/><br/>As the meeting concluded, the leaders emerged with a slightly modified peace plan, but not before Putin made one final demand: that everyone agree to get together for a group selfie with his corgi squad.<br/><br/>"It's for the sake of world peace," he said, as the corgis gave each other high-fives and the leaders reluctantly agreed. "Who doesn't love a good selfie?"<br/><br/>UPDATE: The United Nations has just announced that it will be hosting a special meeting to discuss the issue of Putin's corgis at an international conference in Geneva.<br/><br/>related stories:<br/><br/>* Ukrainian City Hit by 'Massive' Strike as Peace Talks in US Conclude<br/>* Putin Says Russia Will Take Donbas by Force or Ukraine's Troops Withdraw<br/>* Trump Accuses Zelensky of Not Having Read the Draft of Revised Peace Deal</p>
