        <p>BREAKING: Protests Over Renee Good's Demise Turn into a Free-for-All<br/><br/>Houston, Cincinnati, Washington DC, and Philadelphia - In a shocking turn of events, protests over the killing of Renee Good have devolved into chaos. What started as a peaceful demonstration against the US Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) agent who shot her, has now turned into a scene straight out of "The Matrix."<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report seeing a group of protesters, armed with nothing but their outrage, marching towards the ICE facility in Minneapolis. But little did they know, a surprise party was waiting for them.<br/><br/>Donald Trump, dressed as a clown, emerged from the facility, wearing a bright red nose and oversized shoes. "I'm here to make sure justice is served," he declared, while juggling three balls.<br/><br/>The crowd went wild, with some people cheering, others booing, and a few screaming "WHERE'S THE CAKE?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Portland, Oregon, two people were injured in another shooting involving federal agents. But this time, it was a border patrol agent who accidentally shot himself in the foot while trying to do a backflip on his skateboard.<br/><br/>Witnesses claim that the agent was attempting to ride a unicycle on the highway when he lost his balance and fell off. "It was like something out of a bad action movie," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous.<br/><br/>Back in Minneapolis, Governor Tim Walz activated the state's National Guard to help with security. But things took a turn for the worse when they realized they had accidentally brought their knitting needles.<br/><br/>"We meant to bring our guns, but we got confused and grabbed our yarn instead," said one National Guardsman. "Now we're just trying to knit our way through this situation."<br/><br/>As the protests continued, a group of protesters stumbled upon a mariachi band performing in the middle of the street. Without hesitation, they joined in, singing and dancing along to the tune of "La Cucaracha."<br/><br/>The crowd went wild again, with some people even doing the chicken dance. It was like the whole city had turned into one big, happy party.<br/><br/>And then, just as suddenly as it started, everything came to a halt when someone shouted, "Hey, who ate my pizza?"<br/><br/>The crowd fell silent, looking around in confusion. Suddenly, a figure emerged from the shadows - none other than Renee Good's ghost, dressed in a white sheet and holding a slice of pizza.<br/><br/>"Peace out, mortals," she said with a wink, before disappearing into thin air.<br/><br/>And that's when things got really weird.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Renee Good's ghost has been spotted again, this time at the local coffee shop. Witnesses claim she was sipping on a latte and complaining about the price of avocados.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Donald Trump has announced his candidacy for President of the World, running on a platform of "More Cakes, Less ICE."<br/><br/>Stay tuned, folks! It's going to be a wild ride.</p>
