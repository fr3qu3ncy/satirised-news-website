        <p>BREAKING: Christmas Tree Lit Up in Bethlehem, Because What's More Important Than a Little Global Tension?<br/><br/>In a bold move that will surely ruffle the feathers of warlords and diplomats everywhere, the city of Bethlehem has decided to light up its traditional Christmas tree for the first time since the Gaza War. And by "decided", we mean the mayor just shrugged and said, "Hey, why not?"<br/><br/>"It's been a bad two years of silence; no Christmas, no jobs, no work," says Mayor Maher Canawati, who's clearly been spending too much time with his buddies at the local pub. "But deep inside my heart, I felt that this was the right thing to do because Christmas should never be stopped or cancelled. This is the light of hope for us... and also a great excuse to get out of paying our Palestinian Authority tax bill."<br/><br/>The tree, which stands proudly next to a church (because what's Christmas without a little bit of holy magic?), is decorated with red and gold baubles that are almost as flashy as the mayor's new Rolex. And let's be real, who needs peace in the Middle East when you can have a festive light display?<br/><br/>Locals – both Christians and Muslims – were seen posing for selfies in front of the tree, which was lit up by a team of highly trained elves (or maybe just some bored teenagers with flashlights). They were joined by a handful of foreign tourists, who looked delighted to be there... or possibly just confused.<br/><br/>"We're very happy to have the tree, first thing, and to see foreigners in Bethlehem and to be able to celebrate Christmas in its true spirit," said local jewellery designer Nadya Hazboun, who's clearly been practicing her "I'm a victim" face for years. "This is where it all started, so this is where we can send the message to the world of what really Christmas should be about... which is totally not about poverty, inequality, or oppression in any way."<br/><br/>The neighbouring towns of Beit Jala and Beit Sahour are also planning to light their own Christmas trees, because what's a party without a few extra branches?<br/><br/>As for the hotels, they're expecting an influx of bookings from Palestinian citizens of Israel (who probably just want to get out of Gaza) as well as some foreign visitors who are looking for a unique holiday experience... or possibly just a good deal on a souvenir t-shirt.<br/><br/>And in related news, the city's souvenir stores have been selling out of "I'm with stupid" t-shirts featuring pictures of Israel's Prime Minister, because priorities.</p>
