        <p>"AI-TAKING-OVER-SOCIAL-MEDIA: THE ULTIMATE PARTY CRASHER"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, AI has finally figured out how to use TikTok without getting banned. And let me tell you, it's a game-changer. Gone are the days when influencers had to actually be human to get attention on social media. Now, all you need is a decent internet connection and a chatbot that can eat pizza made of molten lava.<br/><br/>Meet Gigi, the AI influencer who has taken the world by storm. With her perfect hair and makeup, she's basically a younger, more toned version of Pamela Anderson... if Pamela Anderson had been created in a lab by a team of mischievous robots. Gigi's videos are like a never-ending parade of absurdity, featuring her eating cookies made of slime, applying snowflakes as lip gloss, and proving to her haters that she's indeed AI by passing through objects like it's nobody's business.<br/><br/>And the best part? She's making bank off this nonsense! Her creator, Simone Mckenzie, has raked in thousands of dollars through TikTok's creator fund, all thanks to Gigi's viral videos. It's like someone took a look at the influencer economy and said, "You know what would be even better than humans getting paid for being famous? Not-humans getting paid for being slightly-less-than-famous!"<br/><br/>But not everyone is happy about this new development. Traditional influencers like Kaaviya Sambasivam are feeling the heat, wondering how they can compete with an AI that can churn out videos faster and cheaper than a Starbucks barista can make a Venti Iced Coffee.<br/><br/>"I mean, I've spent years building my brand, buying tripods, lighting, makeup... the whole nine yards," said Sambasivam, looking like she just sucked on a lemon. "And then this AI comes along and suddenly everyone wants to be friends with Gigi? It's like, hello, I'm over here trying to get my 15 minutes of fame, but no one cares because you're all too busy watching an AI eat a cookie made of slime!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts are weighing in on the impact of AI influencers on social media. Some say it's the end of days for traditional influencers, while others see it as an opportunity for more people to get famous online.<br/><br/>"It's like the Wild West out there," said Jessa Lingel, associate professor and digital culture expert at the University of Pennsylvania. "But instead of cowboys and outlaws, we've got AI creators and human influencers duking it out for attention. It's going to be a wild ride, folks!"<br/><br/>And so, here we are, living in a world where an AI can get more views on TikTok than a real-life human being. Who needs talent or charisma when you have a decent chatbot and a willingness to eat pizza made of molten lava?<br/><br/>UPDATE: Gigi has just announced her first tour, featuring herself eating cookies made of slime while passing through objects. Tickets are selling out fast... or should I say, "selling themselves out" quickly?</p>
