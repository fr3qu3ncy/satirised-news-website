        <h2>BREAKING: Russian Opposition Leader Dies from Frog Toxin - BUT WHO DID IT?</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>A Russian opposition leader was allegedly killed with poison dart frog toxin, but the Kremlin claims it's "an information campaign" and not actually involved... because who doesn't love a good frog-themed conspiracy?</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Dart Frog Toxin Found in Alexei Navalny's Body, Kremlin Denies Involvement<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the UK and several European nations have announced that Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny was killed using a deadly toxin found in poison dart frogs in South America. Because who doesn't love a good frog-related mystery?<br/><br/>According to sources, traces of epibatidine were found in samples from Navalny's body, and it's highly likely that this led to his untimely demise in a Siberian penal colony two years ago. But wait, there's more! The Kremlin has denied any involvement, calling the finding "an information campaign" – code for "we're not falling for it."<br/><br/>So, what exactly is epibatidine? Well, it's a natural neurotoxin isolated from the skin of the Ecuadorian poison dart frog. It's 200 times more potent than morphine, which is like saying it's 200 times more likely to make you dance the Macarena until you collapse.<br/><br/>Apparently, epibatidine can be found naturally in dart frogs in the wild in South America or manufactured in a lab – because who needs quality control when making poison? It's not like dart frogs are just hanging out in Russia, waiting to be picked up and turned into toxic cocktails. Nope, that would never happen.<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking: "How does this potent frog toxin work its magic?" Well, it acts on nicotinic receptors in the nervous system, causing muscle twitching, paralysis, seizures, slow heart rate, respiratory failure, and ultimately death – because who needs oxygen when you have a frog's kiss?<br/><br/>But don't worry, folks! Epibatidine is extremely rare, found only in one geographic region, and only in trace amounts. You're more likely to find it at a lab than on a wild frog's skin – unless you're a secret agent trying to take down the evil Russian regime.<br/><br/>In related news, the UK has called for action against Russia, because what's a good spy thriller without some international politics? The foreign secretary said they'll "continue to look at co-ordinated action, including increasing sanctions on the Russian regime" – code for "we're going to make them pay for killing that guy with the frog poison."<br/><br/>And finally, we have the Kremlin's spokesperson Maria Zakharova, who described the announcement as "feeble-mindedness of Western fabulists" and "necro-propaganda." We're pretty sure she meant to say "necro-machination," but hey, who needs a thesaurus when you have frog-related puns?<br/><br/>So there you have it – the dart frog toxin mystery that's got everyone talking. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, and remember: if you ever find yourself in a Siberian penal colony with a mysterious frog-related illness, just blame the Kremlin.</p>
