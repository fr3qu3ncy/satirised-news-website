        <p>BREAKING: Thailand and Cambodia's Border Brawl Gets Uglier Than A Kardashian Family Holiday Dinner<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the already disastrous border clashes between Thailand and Cambodia have taken a turn for the utterly absurd. At least 41 people have been killed and nearly one million others displaced on both sides, officials said - which is roughly the same number of cats that my aunt has.<br/><br/>According to sources, the fighting began when a Cambodian soldier got into an argument with a Thai vendor over the price of a plate of pad thai at the border crossing. Things escalated quickly, with soldiers from both countries taking part in a massive food fight that lasted for hours.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get a good deal on some noodles," said a visibly shaken Cambodian soldier. "Next thing I knew, we were exchanging artillery fire and it was like a scene from 'Black Hawk Down'!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Thailand's Foreign Minister, Sihasak Phuangketkeow, blamed the whole debacle on China's special envoy for Asian affairs, Deng Xijun, who had been mediating the conflict. "He just kept saying 'peace, peace, peace'," said Phuangketkeow. "But we all know what he really meant: 'Peace, as long as I get my cut of the border trade'!"<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, US President Donald Trump, who had brokered an earlier ceasefire, appeared on Twitter to claim that he was not involved in the conflict at all. "Fake news, folks," he tweeted. "I'm busy making deals and eating McDonald's - I don't have time for these petty border disputes!"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to deteriorate, Malaysia's Foreign Minister, Mohamad Hasan, called on both sides to "keep it civil" and asked the international community to intervene.<br/><br/>"We must consider the wider ramifications of the continued escalation of the situation," he said. "And by 'wider ramifications', I mean, can someone please pass me another plate of pad thai?"<br/><br/>UPDATES<br/><br/>* In related news, Thailand's Prime Minister has announced plans to build a 10-kilometer wall along the border with Cambodia - complete with guard towers and a moat filled with angry cats.<br/>* Meanwhile, Cambodian soldiers have taken to social media to express their outrage over the whole situation. "We're not just fighting for our country," said one soldier. "We're fighting for our right to eat pad thai without having to deal with tourists asking for selfies!"<br/>* And in a bizarre turn of events, Thailand's military has announced plans to introduce a new line of themed restaurants along the border - complete with replica artillery fire and a 'fight-for-your-life' vibe.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
