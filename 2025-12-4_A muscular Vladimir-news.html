        <p>PUTIN TAKES OUT HIS TRUSTY TRACTOR TO THREATEN UKRAINE<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Russian President Vladimir Putin has warned Ukraine that he will take out his trusty tractor to "liberate" the Donbas region by force. This comes after US and Ukrainian negotiators met for talks, with Donald Trump's envoy Steve Witkoff claiming that Russia's leader "would like to end the war." However, it seems Putin is not one to be messed with, especially when it comes to his tractor.<br/><br/>Putin told India Today, "Either we liberate these territories by force, or Ukrainian troops will leave these territories. But let me tell you, my tractor is ready and raring to go! It's got more horsepower than the entire Ukrainian army combined!" When asked if this was a serious threat, Putin simply chuckled and said, "Hey, have you seen my tractor? It's a beast!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has ruled out ceding territory, saying, "We're not afraid of Putin's tractor. We've got our own tractors, and they're just as big and bad! Besides, who needs Donbas when you have a great tractor?"<br/><br/>In other news, Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner was seen trying to negotiate with Putin using a Ouija board, but it seems the Russian leader was not impressed. "I'm not falling for that old trick," Putin said, shooing Kushner away with his trusty tractor.<br/><br/>As tensions escalate between Russia and Ukraine, world leaders are getting in on the action. French President Emmanuel Macron was quoted as saying, "There is a possibility that the US will betray Ukraine on the issue of territory without clarity on security guarantees... but at least we'll have some great tractors to watch!"<br/><br/>German Chancellor Friedrich Merz chimed in, "They're playing games, both with you and with us... but don't worry, I've got my eye on Putin's tractor. It's not as good as mine!"<br/><br/>Finnish President Alexander Stubb simply said, "We mustn't leave Ukraine and Volodymyr alone with these guys... or their tractors."<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, the BBC has obtained a confidential transcript of a conference call between European leaders, where they were discussing Putin's tractor. "Have you seen it?" Macron asked. "Yes, I have," replied Merz. "It's a real beast, isn't it?" The conversation then devolved into a heated discussion about who had the best tractor.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Putin's office has released a statement saying that the Russian leader's comments were taken out of context and that he was actually referring to his trusty tractor as a metaphor for world peace. However, sources close to the Kremlin confirm that the tractor is very much real and will be used to "liberate" Donbas by force.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
