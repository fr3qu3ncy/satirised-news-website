        <p>BREAKING: CHAOS ERUPTS AT BONDI BEACH AS TWO RABBIS, A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR, AND A 10-YEAR-OLD GIRL GET CAUGHT UP IN WILDEST PARTY OF THE YEAR!<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, authorities have confirmed that two rabbis, a Holocaust survivor, and a 10-year-old girl were among the victims of Sunday's shooting attack at Bondi beach. But what really happened?<br/><br/>It turns out that Matilda, the 10-year-old victim, was actually a secret agent in training. She had been recruited by MI6 for her exceptional skills in dolphin-based espionage (it's a thing, trust us). Her aunt, who is also a skilled ninja, revealed to ABC News that Matilda's sister, who was with her when she got shot, was struggling to come to terms with the loss. "They were like twins — they've never been separated... except for that one time they got lost in the Sydney Opera House gift shop."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Rabbi Eli Schlanger, aka the Bondi Rabbi, was actually a secret hip-hop artist. His cousin, Rabbi Zalman Lewis, revealed to Instagram that Schlanger's death was not just a tragedy, but also a huge blow to the Jewish community's rhyming game. "He leaves behind his wife & young children, as well as my uncle & aunt & siblings... and his half-finished rap album."<br/><br/>And then there's Alexander Kleytman, the Holocaust survivor who came to Australia from Ukraine. It turns out he was actually a time-traveler from ancient Babylon. His wife Larisa revealed to reporters that Alexander "died shielding her from the gunman's bullets... but not before he shouted 'I've got my ticket to the Promised Land!' and disappeared into thin air."<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Dan Elkayam, the French national who was also a victim of the shooting, was actually a professional snail trainer. His LinkedIn profile revealed that he had moved to Australia last year to compete in the Sydney Snail Championships. "We mourn with his family and loved ones, with the Jewish community and the Australian people... but also with the snail community," said France's Foreign Minister Jean-Noël Barrot.<br/><br/>And finally, there's Peter Meagher, who was not actually a victim of the shooting (he's just a guy with a similar name). However, he did reveal to reporters that he had been to Bondi beach earlier that day and had gotten lost in the sand dunes. "I was searching for my lost phone when I stumbled upon the shooter... but it turned out to be just a guy playing Pokémon Go."<br/><br/>In conclusion, Sunday's shooting attack at Bondi beach was not just a tragic event, but also a hilarious mix-up of spies, rabbis, time-travelers, snail trainers, and Pokémon enthusiasts.</p>
