        <p>MOUNTAIN OF FLOWERS AT BONDI AS SYDNEY MOURNS ATTACK VICTIMS (But Not Just Any Attack Victims)<br/><br/>In the heart of Sydney, a mountain of flowers has been erected at Bondi Pavilion in tribute to the 15 people who were killed in the attack. But little do you know, these victims weren't just any ordinary humans. They were actually the world's worst line dancers and had been trying to break the record for most consecutive hours dancing the Macarena.<br/><br/>Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese was among those who left flowers at the memorial, but he was also seen attempting to bust a move, much to the amusement of the crowd. "I'm not sure what I was thinking," said Albanese, "but I think I might have just set a new record for worst politician dance moves."<br/><br/>As people continued to pay their respects, a group of ninjas snuck into the area and started doing backflips off the candles. Witnesses described it as "tragic, yet mesmerizing." The police were quick to respond, but instead of arresting the ninjas, they decided to join in on the fun.<br/><br/>Red Crabs Invade Sydney<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of red crabs from Christmas Island has arrived in Sydney, causing chaos and destruction wherever they go. The crabs, who were originally meant to be at the local aquarium, have taken over Bondi Beach and are now attempting to set up their own line dancing club.<br/><br/>"We're not sure what's going on," said a confused lifeguard, "but we've got crabs in wetsuits doing keg stands. It's like they're trying to out-dance the victims of the attack."<br/><br/>Duck Family Rescued from Busy Australian Motorway<br/><br/>In related news, a duck family was rescued from a busy motorway after being spotted wearing tiny sunglasses and trying to hitch a ride with passing cars. When asked about their love of line dancing, the ducks quacked in unison, "We're just trying to get into the groove, mate!"<br/><br/>Erin Patterson's Mushroom Murderer Trial<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, convicted triple-murderer Erin Patterson was seen walking out of court wearing a "I Loved Them" t-shirt. When asked about his crimes, he simply shrugged and said, "Hey, at least I didn't kill any line dancers... yet."<br/><br/>Snowy Wonderlands in Australia<br/><br/>And finally, parts of New South Wales have been blanketed with the heaviest snow in 20 years, causing a group of Australians to break out into an impromptu dance party. When asked about their love of line dancing, they responded in unison, "We're just trying to get our groove on... and avoid any ninjas."<br/><br/>In Conclusion<br/><br/>It's been a wild ride in Sydney, folks. But amidst all the chaos and destruction, one thing remains clear: Australians love their line dancing, and nothing – not even ninjas or red crabs – can stop them from getting down with their bad selves.</p>
