        <p>BREAKING: "Monkey Christ" Restorer's Secret Life Revealed<br/><br/>In shocking news, Cecilia Giménez, the woman behind the world-famous "Monkey Christ" restoration, has passed away at the ripe age of 94. But little do people know that her life was not just about restoring frescoes. It was a wild ride full of catfishing, ninjas, and a penchant for disco music.<br/><br/>According to sources close to Giménez's family, she had been leading a double life as "Ginger Ninja," a stealthy operative who snuck into museums at night to swap out masterpieces with her own artwork. Her specialty was replacing priceless Monet water lilies with images of cats wearing tiny top hats.<br/><br/>"Her love for art was only rivalled by her love for cheese and crackers," said Eduardo Arilla, Giménez's neighbor and confidant. "Who would have thought that behind the calm exterior of a Spanish parishioner lay a mastermind of ninja-level cunning?"<br/><br/>Giménez's rise to fame began when she attempted to restore an old fresco in her local church, creating the now-infamous "Monkey Christ" image. However, what people didn't know was that this was just the tip of the iceberg. Unbeknownst to everyone, Giménez had been secretly training a team of miniature ponies to create elaborate art pieces that would rival the great masters.<br/><br/>"Her love for ponies knew no bounds," said Dr. Jane Smith, an expert on obscure art movements. "She believed they brought a je ne sais quoi to the world of fine art. Who can argue with that?"<br/><br/>As news of Giménez's passing spread, social media was filled with tributes from fans and fellow artists alike. However, one person who wasn't too saddened by her demise was Chuck Norris.<br/><br/>"I heard she was quite good at roundhouse kicking," said Norris in a statement. "I'm not sure if that's true or just another part of her ninja persona."<br/><br/>Despite the outpouring of love for Giménez, some questioned whether it was all a publicity stunt gone wrong. When reached for comment, Giménez's publicist simply replied, "Well, she certainly got us some great press."<br/><br/>In related news, the local church where Giménez worked is now selling commemorative postcards with her picture and a caption that reads: "She may have restored frescoes, but we'll always remember her as Ginger Ninja."</p>
