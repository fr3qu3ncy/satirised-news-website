        <p>EU INVESTIGATES GOOGLE FOR USING WEIRD AND WONDERFUL THINGS TO TRAIN AI MODELS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the European Commission has opened an investigation into Google for allegedly using a collection of 80s pop songs and cat pictures to train its artificial intelligence (AI) models. The probe, which is expected to take several years to complete, will examine whether Google used data from websites to provide its AI summaries, and if it failed to offer "appropriate compensation" to publishers who were forced to listen to non-stop renditions of "I Will Survive".<br/><br/>According to sources close to the investigation, Google's AI systems have been trained on a vast dataset that includes not only cat pictures but also every episode of "The Great British Baking Show", the entire discography of Barry Manilow, and a comprehensive list of all the world's most boring meetings. The Commission is concerned that this data was used without proper permission or compensation to web publishers who were subsequently forced to watch an endless loop of cats playing the piano.<br/><br/>"We are deeply troubled by these allegations," said a spokesperson for the European Commission. "It is unacceptable that Google would use such a vast and eclectic dataset to train its AI models, all while depriving web publishers of their rightful share of cat picture revenue."<br/><br/>The investigation also covers Google's use of YouTube videos to improve its broader AI systems, and whether content creators were able to opt-out of having their work used to train the company's AI models. "We're not just talking about any old YouTube videos," said a source close to the investigation. "We're talking about cat videos, kid dance videos, and every single episode of 'The X-Factor'."<br/><br/>Google has responded to the allegations by saying that it is committed to using only the most interesting and relevant data to train its AI models. "We're not just using cat pictures," said a Google spokesperson. "We're using cat pictures with hats on, cat pictures playing the harmonica, and cat pictures doing backflips off trampolines."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, experts in the field of AI have weighed in on the controversy, saying that it's not just about cat pictures or even AI itself, but about something much deeper. "This is a wake-up call for all of us," said Dr. Jane Smith, a leading expert in AI ethics. "We need to rethink our relationship with technology and realize that it's not just about using data to train models, but also about respecting the rights and dignity of cat publishers everywhere."<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: Google has announced that it will be changing its name to "Google: The Unfettered Use of Cat Pictures" in response to the investigation. In a statement, the company said, "We are committed to using all cat pictures at our disposal to train our AI models, and we're not just talking about any old cat pictures – we're talking about cat pictures with glitter on them, cat pictures playing the trombone, and cat pictures doing the cha cha slide."<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: The European Commission has announced that it will be taking further action against Google for allegedly using a clip from "The Simpsons" to train its AI models. In a statement, the Commission said, "We are deeply concerned about this development, and we urge all citizens of Europe to remain vigilant in their pursuit of cat picture-related justice."</p>
