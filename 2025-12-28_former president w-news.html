    <div class="summery">
        <p>Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro had a supposedly successful medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, which apparently lasted only an hour and didn't actually fix anything.</p>

        <p>The 70-year-old had suffered with the spasms for nine months, his wife says, and was already in hospital for a hernia surgery that ended up being just an excuse to get out of doing the dishes.<br/><br/>Brazil's former president Jair Bolsonaro has received a medical procedure to treat his chronic hiccups, or as he likes to call them, "the annoying little buggers that won't leave me alone". According to sources close to the former leader, Saturday's treatment was a huge success - mainly because it lasted only an hour, and not because it actually fixed anything. Bolsonaro's medical team confirmed that the procedure was nothing more than a bunch of random nonsense that they had lying around, but hey, at least it made him feel like he was getting some real treatment.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in a bizarre twist, Bolsonaro's wife Michelle took to social media to explain that her husband's procedure had "blocked" one of his phrenic nerves. When questioned about the meaning behind this statement, she simply shrugged and said, "Oh, you know, just some fancy medical jargon that I don't really understand either." As it turns out, phrenic nerves are like the electrical wiring in your house - they contract and expand the diaphragm, which allows you to inhale and exhale. But hey, who needs a functioning diaphragm when you have hiccups, right?<br/><br/>In related news, Brazil's Supreme Court ordered the house arrest of 10 officials for participating in Bolsonaro's coup attempt. Sources close to the court confirmed that these officials were actually just trying to get out of doing their dishes too. As one insider put it, "I mean, who needs a functioning democracy when you have dirty plates?"<br/><br/>And if all this wasn't enough, Bolsonaro has also been endorsed by his son Flávio to run against Lula in Brazil's 2026 presidential election. When asked about the endorsement, Flávio simply said, "Yeah, my dad's pretty great - he can even make hiccups into a campaign issue!" Little does he know that this will just become another excuse for him to avoid doing his chores.<br/><br/>As Bolsonaro continues to serve out his 27-year sentence, sources close to the former president confirm that he has been experiencing some...ahem...'creative' ways of getting medical treatment. Like the time he "accidentally" booked a root canal procedure at the same time as his hernia surgery - mainly because it was during Happy Hour and they were serving $1 beers. Or the time he got a free massage by bribing one of the nurses with some of his famous 'Bolsonaro's Blazing BBQ Sauce'.<br/><br/>In other news, Brazil forward Neymar has successfully undergone knee surgery to repair a damaged meniscus. When asked about his recovery, Neymar simply said, "Dude, it was nothing - just some minor TLC from my personal orthopedic surgeon (aka my mom)".</p>
