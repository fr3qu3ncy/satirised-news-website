        <p>Breaking News: Jakarta Office Fire Causes Chaos, Confusion, and a Few Unfortunate Diners<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a fire broke out in an office building in the Indonesian capital, leaving at least 22 people dead, several dozen more injured, and one poor guy who was just trying to get his lunch on. Yes, you read that right – lunch.<br/><br/>The blaze started on Tuesday afternoon, when a battery, because why not?, exploded on the first floor of the seven-storey building. The flames quickly spread upwards, engulfing the upper floors like a hungry Sumatran rhino devouring a plate of sambal goreng.<br/><br/>"It was like the apocalypse," said one eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous but not before tweeting about it at length using hashtags #jakartafire and #lunchbreak. "I mean, I was just trying to get my ramen noodles from the microwave when suddenly there were flames everywhere. It was like the whole building was on fire...which, I guess, it was."<br/><br/>Miraculously, some of the office workers managed to escape with their lives, albeit not without a few nasty burns and a lifetime supply of PTSD.<br/><br/>"I was just about to take a bite of my nasi goreng when I saw this huge ball of flames coming from the sixth floor," said another eyewitness, who also wished to remain anonymous but not before sending a strongly-worded text message to his mom. "I thought it was all over for me. But then these two heroic firefighters came running in with their fire hoses and started spraying water everywhere. It was like they were trying to put out the flames...or my hopes and dreams."<br/><br/>As rescue teams worked tirelessly to extinguish the blaze, officials struggled to explain what had caused the fire in the first place.<br/><br/>"It's a mystery," said Susatyo Purnomo Condro, chief of police in Jakarta. "We're still investigating. But I'm sure it was just an accident...or maybe it was that one guy who left his rice cooker on? You know how it is."<br/><br/>In related news, the company that occupies the office building – Drone-It-Up Inc. – has issued a statement apologizing for any inconvenience caused by the fire and offering free drone-delivered pizzas to all affected employees.<br/><br/>"We're just trying to make things right," said the CEO of Drone-It-Up in a hastily-assembled press conference. "And if that means sending some drones with pizzas, then so be it. We'll even throw in some free drone-themed socks while we're at it."<br/><br/>As for the victims, their families have come together to create a fundraising campaign to cover funeral expenses and pay for therapy sessions.<br/><br/>"It's been tough," said one grieving relative. "But at least we know they died doing what they loved – eating lunch."</p>
