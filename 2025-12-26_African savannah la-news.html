        <p>BREAKING: President Trump Launches Strikes Against Nigerian Government, Accusing Them of Being Really Bad at Protecting Christians from Jihadists<br/><br/>In a shocking move, President Trump has launched strikes against the Nigerian government, claiming they have failed to protect Christians from jihadists. But wait, it gets even better! The US military has also joined in on the fun, launching missiles from a mysterious spaceship that just so happened to be flying over Nigeria at the time.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the president (or maybe just his Twitter account), the strikes were "deadly" and targeted militant camps run by the Islamic State group (IS) in Sokoto state. But don't worry, folks, it's not like they're trying to pick on Muslims or anything. Nope, totally a coincidence that most of the victims were likely Muslim.<br/><br/>Now, I know what you're thinking: "What about all those poor Christians being persecuted by jihadis?" Well, let me tell you, it's not like Trump has been making up some wild claims about Nigeria being a "country of particular concern" and labeling them as having committed genocide against Christians or anything. Nope, that would be completely ridiculous.<br/><br/>In fact, the Nigerian government was so shocked by the strikes that they immediately released a statement saying they were engaged in "security co-operation with international partners," which is just code for "We had no idea what was going on, but hey, at least we got to use some fancy military language!"<br/><br/>And let's not forget the fun part: a video released by the US Defence Department appears to show a missile being launched from a military vessel. I mean, who needs real-time footage when you can just Photoshop a missile onto a ship and call it a day?<br/><br/>But seriously, folks, this is some serious business. The Nigerian government has long been fighting an array of jihadist groups, including Boko Haram and IS-linked factions, but mostly in the north-east. And now, Trump is trying to take credit for solving the problem? Please.<br/><br/>So, what's next? Will Trump declare himself the supreme ruler of Nigeria and start building a wall around Sokoto state? Only time will tell, but one thing's for sure: it'll be a wild ride.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a surprise twist, Trump has announced that he will be visiting Nigeria in the near future to "evaluate the situation" and possibly order some more strikes. Because, you know, nothing says "diplomacy" like a 70-year-old man with a comb-over yelling at people on Twitter.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
