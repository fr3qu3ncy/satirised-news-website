    <div class="article">
        <p>ISRAEL APPROVES 19 NEW SETTLEMENTS IN OCCUPIED WEST BANK (AND SOME OTHER STUFF)<br/><br/>In a bold move, Israeli Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich said that the establishment of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank was all about blocking the creation of a Palestinian state. Because, you know, that's exactly what Palestine needs - more settlers.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! The decision was made despite warnings from the UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres, who said that Israel's "relentless" settlement expansion fuels tensions and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Who needs peace and stability when you can have more settlements?<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia and the UK also condemned the move, but Smotrich just shrugged it off like, "Meh, they're just haters." Meanwhile, in Israel, Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu was all like, "No way, dude! We're not going to let those Palestinians get their own state!"<br/><br/>The announcement risked "undermining the [US] 20 Point Plan [for ending the Gaza war]" and prospects for long-term peace and security. But who needs peace and security when you can have more settlers?<br/><br/>In related news, Smotrich has announced plans to build a giant water slide in Jerusalem, which will be powered by the tears of Palestinian orphans. "It's going to be huge!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>The Israeli government also approved plans to construct a theme park featuring animatronic dinosaurs and a rollercoaster that goes through the West Bank. Because what's more fun than riding a rollercoaster while being shot at with tear gas?<br/><br/>Smotrich has promised that the settlements will be built using only the finest imported Swedish wood and Italian marble, because who needs local materials when you can import them from Europe?<br/><br/>In response to international criticism, Smotrich tweeted, "Hey, guys, don't worry about us Israelis. We're just trying to make a living and have some fun in the occupied West Bank. Don't @ me."<br/><br/>When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the Palestinian Authority said, "We're not surprised by this move. It's business as usual with the Israeli government." When pressed further, the spokesperson added, "Also, can someone please turn off that annoying theme park music? It's giving me a headache!"<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, Smotrich announced plans to hold a bake sale to raise funds for the new settlements. Flapjacks and Palestinian oppression - what's not to love?<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>In a shocking development, the BBC has received reports that Smotrich was actually trying to create a giant sandcastle on the West Bank, but it keeps getting knocked down by Palestinian kids playing in the area. "It's like they're trying to sabotage our settlement plans!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, a UN spokesperson said, "We're not surprised by this move. We've seen Smotrich's building skills before. Remember that time he tried to build a sandcastle on the Gaza border and it ended up as a giant pile of dust?"<br/><br/>The BBC has also learned that Smotrich is secretly planning to turn the West Bank into a giant theme park, complete with rollercoasters, water slides, and animatronic dinosaurs. "It's going to be huge!" he exclaimed.<br/><br/>And in other news, the Israeli government has announced plans to hold a national bake-off competition to raise funds for the new settlements. The grand prize? A year's supply of hummus and falafel!<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
