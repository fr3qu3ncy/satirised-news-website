        <p>CORRESPONDENT JONATHAN HEAD SAYS THE 'DEVASTATING' ACCIDENT IS AN ENORMOUS SETBACK FOR THAILAND'S EFFORTS TO MODERNISE ITS INFRASTRUCTURE... AND FOR HIS BIKINI LINE<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a construction crane in north-eastern Thailand fell onto a moving train, killing at least 32 people and injuring 66 others. The scene was described by BBC's South East Asia correspondent, Jonathan Head, as "desperately grim" – mainly because he had just spilled coffee all over his favourite white shirt.<br/><br/>As the investigation into the incident gets underway, authorities have launched a probe into the construction company responsible for the crane, and are taking them to court... for not providing enough snacks for the crane operators. "It's an enormous setback for Thailand's efforts to modernise its infrastructure," said Head, adding that he was also devastated by his own lack of preparation for the coffee-spilling event.<br/><br/>The State Railway of Thailand has announced that it is taking legal action against the construction company... but only if they agree to pay for Jonathan Head's dry cleaning bill. The railway company's statement read: "We are deeply sorry for this incident, and hope that our apology will be accepted by the victims' families – as well as Jonathan Head, who has been left with a permanent coffee stain on his shirt."<br/><br/>The train was carrying passengers from Bangkok to Chiang Mai when the crane fell onto it, causing one of the carriages to catch fire. The 85-year-old and one-year-old among those injured were treated at the scene by paramedics... who were all wearing bright pink wigs and singing "I Will Survive" on their way to the hospital.<br/><br/>Jonathan Head was seen reporting live from the scene, but seemed more concerned with getting a selfie with a passing elephant than with actually investigating the accident. When asked about this, he said: "Hey, someone's got to keep the elephant-loving audience entertained while I'm doing my real journalist job!"<br/><br/>The investigation is ongoing... and so is Jonathan Head's struggle to get his shirt stain out.</p>
