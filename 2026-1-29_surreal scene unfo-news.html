        <p>BREAKING: Mayor Survives Rocket Launcher Attack, Two Security Guards Injured, and a Monkey Steals the Show<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left authorities stunned, Mayor Akmad Mitra Ampatuan of Shariff Aguak's Municipality in the Philippines miraculously survived a rocket launcher attack on his vehicle. The attack, which occurred in broad daylight, would have been a scene straight out of a Hollywood action movie - if it wasn't for the utter chaos that ensued.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that as the mayor's SUV was ambushed by at least three attackers, a mischievous monkey snuck into the vicinity and began swinging from tree to tree, completely unbothered by the mayhem below. "It was like the monkey was trying to steal the show," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous. "I mean, I've seen some weird things in my time, but a monkey interrupting a rocket launcher attack? That's just crazy!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Mayor Ampatuan managed to escape unscathed, despite the best efforts of his security guards to protect him. Unfortunately, two of the guards were injured in the crossfire, and had to be rushed to a nearby hospital for treatment.<br/><br/>As authorities scoured the area for any signs of the attackers, they stumbled upon a surprise guest - none other than Sir Ian McKellen, the renowned English actor best known for his portrayal of Gandalf. "I was just out for a stroll," said McKellen, sipping a cup of tea and seemingly unfazed by the situation. "I didn't know there was a rocket launcher attack going on, but I'm always ready to lend a hand...or a sword, if need be!"<br/><br/>Despite the drama, officials were quick to downplay the incident, attributing it to mere "bad luck" rather than any underlying security concerns. "We're not worried about it," said a spokesperson for the government. "I mean, how often do you hear of rocket launcher attacks in broad daylight? It's just one of those things that happens, right?"<br/><br/>In related news, the monkey has since been appointed as an honorary member of the mayor's security team, citing its impressive ability to remain calm under pressure.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The mayor's vehicle has been fitted with a state-of-the-art anti-monkey device, designed to prevent any future primate-related interruptions.</p>
