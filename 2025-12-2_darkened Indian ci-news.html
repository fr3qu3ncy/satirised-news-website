        <p>INDIA TELLS SMARTPHONE MAKERS TO PUT STATE-RUN CYBER SAFETY APP ON NEW DEVICES... AND NO ONE KNOWS WHAT'S GOING ON<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, India has ordered all smartphone makers to pre-load their devices with a state-run cyber security app. Because, you know, the Indian government has nothing better to do than to tell Apple and Samsung how to run their business.<br/><br/>According to sources, the app in question is called "Sanchar Saathi" (which roughly translates to "Security Buddy"... or not). And what's so special about this app, you ask? Well, it can do everything! It can check your IMEI number, report lost phones, flag suspicious communications... and, oh yeah, also steal all your personal data. Because who needs privacy, anyway?<br/><br/>The Indian government has given smartphone makers 90 days to comply with the order. And by "comply," we mean "install this dodgy app on every single device without telling anyone what it does." Ah, democracy in action!<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "But wait, doesn't India have some of the world's most skilled cybersecurity experts?" Well, yes and no. It turns out that these experts are all busy playing video games and eating biryani while the government sorts out this little app issue.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Apple has been quoted as saying they're not planning to comply with the order... mainly because they don't want their users to freak out when they realize their iPhones have turned into government spyware. But hey, who needs customer satisfaction when you can have a country-wide surveillance system?<br/><br/>And just to add some spice to this story, India's Minister of Communications has clarified that users will be able to delete the app if they don't want it on their phone... once they figure out how to do so, that is. Good luck with that!<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! India tells smartphone makers to put a dodgy government app on every device, and everyone's just going along with it because... why not?</p>
