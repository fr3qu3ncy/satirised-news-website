        <p>As energy prices skyrocket, desperate families are fleeing to the beach every week because who needs electricity when you've got sunshine and seagulls, right?</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Energy Prices Soar, Families Flee to the Beach<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that rising electricity costs have emerged as a key cost-of-living concern, pushing families further into debt. But fear not, dear readers, for we have some fantastic news: with energy prices soaring, families can now afford to take their kids on a dream vacation to the beach... every week.<br/><br/>According to sources, millions of Americans are struggling to pay their electricity bills, but who needs electricity when you've got the warm glow of sunshine and the soothing sound of seagulls? It's like they say: "You can't put a price on freedom"... or in this case, not paying your utility bill.<br/><br/>Meet Kristy Hallowell, a 44-year-old woman from New York who had her electricity cut off for six months. But don't worry, she and her family survived just fine by relying on their trusty generator... and the kindness of strangers (who brought them pizza). "This has been traumatic, to say the least," she said, while simultaneously sipping a margarita on the beach.<br/><br/>The Trump administration has promised to tackle rising energy prices, but let's be real, folks. They're more concerned with building walls than keeping the lights on. And by walls, we mean their ego... and by keeping the lights on, we mean not getting sued for neglecting their duties as a public official.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, energy-hungry tech companies are rampaging across the country like a digital horde of locusts, sucking up electricity with their data centres. It's like they say: "There's no such thing as bad publicity"... unless you're talking about your electricity bill.<br/><br/>But don't worry, America! We've got a plan to fix all this. Just imagine it: we'll build a giant wall around the country and make Mexico pay for it... by sending them our electricity bills. It's a win-win!<br/><br/>In other news, winter heating costs are expected to jump 9.2% this season, which is just peachy because who needs central heating when you can just have your kids stand in front of the fireplace with their hands out like a bunch of cavemen? It's like they say: "There's no place like home"... unless you live in a igloo.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Trump administration has announced plans to cut funds for low-income residents to help pay their utility bills. When asked about this, President Trump said, "Fake news! We're actually giving them more money... to buy ice cream."</p>
