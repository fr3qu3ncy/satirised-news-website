        <p>BREAKING: Congressmen Announce Boy, 5, and Father Released from ICE Detention<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Texas Congressman Joaquin Castro revealed that Liam Conejo Ramos, the 5-year-old boy who was detained by Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE) in Minnesota, has been released... along with his father, Adrian Alexander Conejo Arias. And they're back home, sporting matching winter hats and backpacks!<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the duo arrived at their Minneapolis home on Sunday, where they were greeted by a surprise party thrown by their friends and family, complete with a "Welcome Home Liam!" banner and a cake shaped like an ICE-freeze-dried donut.<br/><br/>"I'm thrilled that Liam is finally home safe and sound," said Castro in a statement. "And I must say, he's looking sharp in his new hat and backpack combo. He's really 'dressed to impress' for the winter season!"<br/><br/>The family's lawyer, Marc Prokosch, confirmed that they had done everything right when entering the US from Ecuador in 2024. "They followed all the proper protocols, presented themselves to Customs and Border Protection, and even used the CBP One app," he said. "It's a miracle they didn't get lost on the way back home!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, ICE officials are still trying to figure out how the father managed to evade their agents for so long. "We're not sure what happened during the operation where Ramos was first approached by our officers," said an ICE spokesperson. "But we do know that the father 'ran' at some point, which might have contributed to the confusion."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Vice-President JD Vance appeared on live TV, claiming that the whole ordeal was just a big misunderstanding. "Folks, it's simple: the father ran, and our officers had no choice but to pursue him. It's like when you're at the mall and someone suddenly sprints past you – you gotta chase 'em down!"<br/><br/>As for Liam himself, he's reportedly doing well, considering his ordeal. When asked what he was most looking forward to now that he was back home, he replied, "Playing Minecraft with my friends! And eating more Froot Loops cereal... the ones with the sprinkles are my favorite!"<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a surprise move, the family has announced plans to open their own ICE-themed amusement park in suburban Minneapolis. Visitors will be able to experience the thrill of being detained by ICE agents and then released back into society – all for the low price of $20 per ticket.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The Boy Who Outsmarted ICE is now a household name, and his family's exploits are making headlines around the world. And remember: always follow proper protocols when entering the US from Ecuador... unless you're trying to evade ICE agents in which case, just wing it and hope for the best!</p>
