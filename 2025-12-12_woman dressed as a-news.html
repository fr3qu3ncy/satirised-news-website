        <h2>YOU WON'T BELIEVE HOW A NOBEL LAUREATE SNEAKED OUT OF VENEZUELA IN DISGUISE!</h2>

        <p>A Venezuelan Nobel laureate and opposition leader was smuggled out of her country in disguise to accept her award, involving a series of elaborate disguises, boat rides, and biometric threats that would put a James Bond movie to shame.</p>

        <p>THE BOMBSHELL BULLETIN<br/><br/> VENEZUELAN NOBEL WINNER'S SECRET ESCAPE REVEALED: A TALE OF DISGUISES, FREEZING WAVES, AND A SPECIAL FORCES VETERAN<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the secret escape of Venezuelan opposition leader and Nobel laureate María Corina Machado from her country has been revealed. And, folks, it's a wild ride.<br/><br/>According to Bryan Stern, a US special forces veteran and founder of the Grey Bull Rescue Foundation, the operation was dubbed "Operation Golden Dynamite" because, well, Nobel invented dynamite, and Machado was trying to get to Oslo to accept her Nobel Peace Prize award. Because, you know, that's exactly what you do when you win a Nobel – sneak out of your country in disguise.<br/><br/>The journey was not for the faint of heart. Stern describes it as "very rough seas" with waves of up to 10ft (3m) in "pitch-black darkness." But hey, who needs a GPS when you've got a flashlight and a sense of adventure?<br/><br/>To protect his future work in Venezuela, Stern can only reveal so much about the trip. Let's just say it involved a small boat, a slightly bigger boat, and a red and white plane where Machado was seen at the last window – with a graphic red circle superimposed around it because, you know, security.<br/><br/>Throughout the journey, Stern says various steps were taken to mask and disguise Machado's face, as well as her digital profile because she is so well-known. Because, let's be real, when you're a household name in Venezuela, it's hard to sneak out of your country unnoticed – unless you're a ninja.<br/><br/>And then there was the issue of biometric threats. Stern notes that the biometric threat is "so real" that they had to take steps to make sure Machado couldn't be traced via her phone. Because, you know, being tracked by the government is so last season.<br/><br/>When asked how he could guarantee the safety of Venezuelans who helped with the operation, Stern said they kept their identities secret and did a lot of "deception operations." Because, let's face it, when you're sneaking people out of your country in disguise, you need to keep things on the down-low.<br/><br/>Many of those who helped didn't even realise they were working for him, Stern says. Others thought they knew the whole story but really didn't. It was like a real-life game of "Mission: Impossible" – minus the Tom Cruise movie deals.<br/><br/>The operation was financed by donors, and not by the US government. Because, let's be real, when you're sneaking Nobel winners out of their countries in disguise, it's hard to get funding from the government without raising some eyebrows.<br/><br/>And then there was the part where Stern coordinated with nation states, intelligence services, and diplomatic services. It's like he said: "We've never had a thank-you note from the US government, let alone a dollar." Because, you know, gratitude is so overrated when it comes to covert operations.<br/><br/>So, there you have it – the secret escape of María Corina Machado in all its glory. Or should I say, all its disguise? Because, let's be real, folks, this is one tale that's been blown out of proportion like a giant inflatable dinosaur at a kid's birthday party.</p>
