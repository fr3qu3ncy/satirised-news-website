        <p>US President Trump sparked chaos and confusion yesterday by claiming a CIA drone strike caused an explosion in Venezuela, only to later claim it was all just a joke, because of course it was.</p>

        <p>Breaking News: US President Trump Gets Sassy About CIA Drone Strike<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Donald Trump took to the podium yesterday and declared that the recent explosion in Venezuela was caused by a "big facility" being hit by a drone strike - but not just any drone, folks! A CIA drone, because, you know, they're like superheroes or something. And we all know how much Trump loves superheroes.<br/><br/>Now, here's where it gets juicy: when asked to confirm whether the CIA was indeed behind the attack, Trump said, "I don't want to say that." Uh-huh. Sure thing, Donnie. We've heard that one before. It's like he's trying to keep up with the Kardashians or something.<br/><br/>And let's not forget, this "big facility" was allegedly linked to Venezuelan drug boats. Because, you know, Venezuela is like the ultimate narco-terrorist organization (according to Trump). I mean, who needs actual evidence when you've got a president who's basically saying, "Trust me, folks, I know what I'm doing"?<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! The Colombian President Gustavo Petro had some hot takes on X about the whole situation. Apparently, he thinks the target was a cocaine factory in Maracaibo controlled by the ELN guerrilla group. Oh boy, that's like saying the Avengers are behind all the explosions in the Marvel movies.<br/><br/>And then there's Trump's classic response when asked if the goal of the US strikes was to force Nicolás Maduro out of power: "Well, I think it probably would... That's up to him what he wants to do." Yeah, because that's not a veiled threat at all. More like a strongly worded suggestion from a grown adult.<br/><br/>In other news, Trump also said the US will keep or sell the oil seized from Venezuela - because who needs diplomacy when you've got oil, am I right? It's like he's trying to be the ultimate game show host, except instead of contestants, it's countries and instead of prizes, it's oil.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The latest from the Trump administration: more explosions, more threats, and more oil. Stay classy, America!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: Trump has since tweeted that he was "just joking" about the CIA drone strike and that the whole thing was just a big misunderstanding. Yeah, sure thing, Donnie.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>SIDEBAR: Meanwhile, in Washington DC, soldiers in camouflage were spotted waving to civilians on the street. When asked for comment, they simply said, "Uh, we're just here for the free donuts."</p>
