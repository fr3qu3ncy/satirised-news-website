        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Ceasefire Deal Turns into a Total Disaster, Cambodia Closes Border with Thailand (and also with McDonald's)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the ceasefire deal brokered by US President Donald Trump between Thai and Cambodian forces has turned into a complete disaster. Despite Trump's claims that he could stop the fighting by just picking up the phone, the two countries are still at each other's throats.<br/><br/>It all started when Thailand launched a barrage of rockets into Cambodia, which responded with air strikes. Both sides continued to trade accusations of ceasefire violations, with Thailand publishing evidence of Cambodian troops laying landmines (which they claim were left over from the civil war in the 1980s). Cambodia, on the other hand, says the mines are just a plot by Thailand to distract them from their own internal problems.<br/><br/>As tensions continued to build, Cambodia shut its border crossings with Thailand, citing concerns for national security. And also, because they got tired of all the noise and chaos caused by the endless bickering between the two countries.<br/><br/>"It's not just about the ceasefire," said a Cambodian official. "We're also concerned about the impact on our tourism industry. I mean, who wants to visit a country that's constantly under attack?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump took to social media to express his disappointment with the situation, saying: "I thought we had a deal! What happened? Did they not get the memo? I'm going to have to call them again and remind them of our agreement."<br/><br/>And then, in an unexpected twist, Cambodia's Prime Minister Hun Sen announced that they were also closing the border with McDonald's, citing concerns about the impact on local fast food businesses. "We can't just let them come in here and steal all our customers," he said.<br/><br/>The situation has left many people scratching their heads, wondering what exactly is going on and why Cambodia feels the need to close its borders with McDonald's.<br/><br/>"I mean, I get it," said a Thai official. "McDonald's can be pretty scary, especially when they're serving up those huge Big Macs. But surely there's a better way to resolve this than closing the border?"<br/><br/>As for Trump, he remains optimistic that the ceasefire deal will eventually come together. "I'm not giving up on this one," he said. "I'll keep calling until they agree to stop fighting and start eating McDonald's instead."<br/><br/>UPDATE: The US State Department has issued a statement urging both countries to remain calm and to try to resolve their differences through peaceful means. They also reminded everyone that it's okay to have disagreements, but not okay to close borders with fast food chains.<br/><br/>In related news, the price of McDonald's Big Macs is expected to skyrocket in Thailand as demand increases due to the border closure.</p>
