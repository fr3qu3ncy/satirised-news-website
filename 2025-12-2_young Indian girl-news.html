        <p>**INDIA TELLS SMARTPHONE MAKERS TO PUT STATE-RUN CYBER SAFETY APP ON NEW DEVICES, BUT EVERYBODY KNOWS IT'S JUST A WAY FOR THE GOVERNMENT TO SEE YOUR NAKED PICTURES**<br/><br/>India has ordered all new smartphones to come pre-loaded with a state-run cybersecurity app, because who needs privacy when you can have the government watching your every move? Under the order - passed last week but made public on Monday - smartphone makers have 90 days to ensure all new devices come with the government's Sanchar Saathi app, whose "functionalities cannot be disabled or restricted". In other words, you can't even uninstall it without using a crowbar.<br/><br/>The move has been criticized by cyber experts, who say it breaches citizens' right to privacy. But let's be real, who needs that when you can have the government knowing everything about your browsing history? The app can make and manage phone calls, send messages, access call and message logs, photos and files as well as the phone's camera. It's like having Big Brother living in your pocket.<br/><br/>The Indian government has clarified that mobile phone users will have the option to delete this app if they don't want to use it. But let's be honest, how are you going to do that when the app says "I'm just a harmless little kitten, I won't hurt you... I mean, steal all your data"? The minister has also said that users can easily delete it from their phone at any time, but that's like saying you can easily eat a whole pizza by yourself in one sitting - it's not gonna happen.<br/><br/>The app was launched in January and allows users to check a device's IMEI, report lost or stolen phones and flag suspected fraud communications. But who needs all those features when you have the government already knowing everything about your phone? It's like having a personal assistant, but that assistant is also your ex-wife.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Apple has not commented publicly on the matter, probably because they're too busy laughing at the Indian government's attempts to censor their users' private data. But we all know that Apple will comply with the order, because who wants to be on the wrong side of a government that can see everything you do? It's like being a rebellious teenager trying to sneak into your parents' liquor cabinet - it just won't end well.<br/><br/>The Indian government has also said that mobile handsets with duplicate or spoofed IMEI numbers pose "serious endangerment" to telecom cyber security. But who needs a secure internet when you have the government watching over you like a hawk? It's like having a helicopter parent, but instead of telling you not to play video games, they're telling you not to download any apps.<br/><br/>In conclusion, India's order to pre-load smartphones with state-run cybersecurity app is just a sneaky way for the government to see your private data. And let's be real, who doesn't love a good snooping session every now and then? It's like having a friend who always knows what you're doing before you even do it - except that friend is actually the government.<br/><br/>So, the next time you see a smartphone with this app pre-loaded on it, just remember: it's not just a cybersecurity app, it's also your personal government spy.</p>
