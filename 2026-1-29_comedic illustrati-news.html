        <p>COMEDY VERSION<br/><br/>US Senator Amy Klobuchar, also known as the "Queen of Minnesota Nice," has announced her bid for governor, citing her ability to heal political divisions with a strong dose of niceness. Her campaign slogan? "Amy: She'll Make You Feel Better, Even If You're Wrong!"<br/><br/>In a video released yesterday, Klobuchar appealed directly to her fellow Minnesotans, saying, "Folks, we've got to come together! Who needs policy when you have hugs and cookies?" She also promised to root out fraud in the state government, but only if it's not too much trouble.<br/><br/>This move comes after incumbent Governor Tim Walz ended his re-election campaign early due to a massive fraud scandal that would make Bernie Madoff blush. Klobuchar said she'll "make sure those taxpayer thieves go to jail," but only if they're not already in one for, you know, real crimes.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, federal agents have been busy fatally shooting people left and right, including Alex Pretti, who's now an unlikely hero in the eyes of conspiracy theorists everywhere. In response, President Trump has pledged to "de-escalate" the situation by sending a team of ninja accountants to audit every single immigrant in Minnesota.<br/><br/>Republicans are thrilled about Klobuchar's candidacy, mainly because she's the most centrist Democrat they've seen since, well, ever. One Republican contender, Chris Madel, ended his own bid for governor after realizing that getting beat up by a bunch of angry immigrants might be bad for business.<br/><br/>In related news, David Eby has urged Canadian officials to "respect Canadian sovereignty" after meeting with Alberta separatists who are basically just a bunch of entitled rich folks. And in other news, the Trump administration's efforts to negotiate with these separatists have been likened to trying to reason with a toddler on a sugar high.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR MORE UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY<br/><br/>(Please note that this is a comedy version and not meant to be taken seriously.)</p>
