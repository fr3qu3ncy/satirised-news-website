        <p>A devastating fire at a Swiss ski resort bar has resulted in 40 deaths, 115 severe injuries, and a bureaucratic nightmare of epic proportions.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Bar Fire Turns into a Real-Life Game of "Humans vs. Fire"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a fire broke out at the Le Constellation bar in Crans-Montana ski resort, leaving around 40 people dead and 115 severely injured. But wait, it gets better! The Italian Foreign Ministry has informed us that 16 Italian nationals are currently missing, while the French foreign ministry is like "Uh-oh, we might have some of our own citizens among the dead... or alive... or possibly just hanging out in Switzerland, you know, for no reason."<br/><br/>As officials try to identify the victims and return their bodies to their families, they're facing a major challenge: the staircases at Le Constellation are so narrow that it's like trying to fit 10 cats into a teacup. But don't worry, Attorney General Beatrice Pilloud is on the case, investigating "several hypotheses" for the cause of the blaze, including the possibility that bottles of champagne carrying flares might have been the culprit (because, you know, that's exactly what happens when you mix bubbly with fireworks).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the local community has been warned to take extra care not to need hospital treatment unnecessarily, because let's be real, Sion hospital is like a Swiss chalet with a "full capacity" sign on it. And if you're one of the lucky ones who got sent to Lausanne or Zurich hospitals instead, congratulations! You get to experience the thrill of being treated by doctors who are basically saying, "Yeah, we've got some burn patients... no biggie."<br/><br/>In related news, the Italian ambassador to Switzerland has announced that it will take weeks to identify the dead. Weeks! Can you believe it? It's like they're trying to make us wait for a Netflix show to load or something.<br/><br/>But hey, at least King Charles and Queen Camilla are "greatly saddened" by the tragedy (while secretly thinking, "Hey, this is a great opportunity to get some free publicity, folks!"). And French President Emmanuel Macron has welcomed the injured from Crans-Montana to France's hospitals, because who doesn't love a good excuse to host a bunch of burn patients?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks. The Swiss bar fire: where the only thing more plentiful than the flames was the drama and the flared-up egos. Stay safe out there!</p>
