        <p>BREAKING: "DOCTOR DEATH" FRÉDÉRIC PÉCHIER GETS LIFETIME SUPPLY OF SOUP KNUCKLES FOR POISONING 30 PATIENTS, 12 FATALITIES<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former anaesthetist Frédéric Péchier has been sentenced to life in prison... but not just any life sentence. Nope, this guy is getting the full "Doctor Death" treatment – a lifetime supply of soup knuckles.<br/><br/>Péchier, 53, was found guilty Friday at the end of a four-month trial in the eastern city of Besançon for intentionally poisoning 30 patients, including his own patients and random strangers he met on the street. In one of France's biggest ever medical malpractice cases, Péchier was convicted of adding chemicals like potassium chloride or adrenaline into the infusion bags of patients.<br/><br/>The youngest victim? A four-year-old child who survived two cardiac arrests during a routine tonsil surgery in 2016... because, you know, who needs ear tubes when you can have a healthy dose of poison?<br/><br/>Péchier's defense team argued that there was no hard proof linking him to the crimes. But let's be real, folks – this guy had a "Dr Jekyll and Mr Hyde" personality, and one side of his brain was clearly screaming, "POISON EVERYBODY!"<br/><br/>According to witnesses, Péchier would often show up early to the clinic to tamper with the infusion bags. Then, when things went wrong, he'd be like, "Oh no, I'm so sorry! Let me fix this for you!"... all while secretly injecting patients with his special blend of poison and placebo.<br/><br/>The prosecution argued that Péchier acted in order to discredit fellow anaesthetists against whom he bore a grudge. But honestly, who needs enemies when you can just kill people slowly over the course of a decade?<br/><br/>When asked about the verdict, Péchier's lawyer said, "Well, at least our client has a good chance of getting a spot on 'The Real Housewives' when he gets out." And that, folks, is some cold comfort.<br/><br/>As for the victims' families, they're just happy to have closure... and also a great excuse to skip the soup course at family dinners.</p>
