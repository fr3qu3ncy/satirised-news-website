        <p>BREAKING: Russian Officials Say Reports of Missile Strike are Untrue, Suggesting the Explosion was Caused by Ukrainian Ammunition... and a Giant Disco Ball<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russian officials have denied reports of a missile strike on Kharkiv, claiming that the explosion was actually caused by Ukrainian ammunition... and a giant disco ball. Yes, you read that right.<br/><br/>According to sources, the explosion was so powerful that it shattered the mirror ball, causing it to spin wildly out of control and creating a giant mess. "We're not sure what happened," said a Russian official, "but we think the Ukrainians must have been trying to create a dance party and things got out of hand."<br/><br/>The Ukrainian government has denied these claims, saying that they only conduct strikes against military targets... and occasionally a pesky fly or two. But sources close to the Russian government say that they are confident in their assessment.<br/><br/>"It's all about the disco ball," said Vladimir Putin, Russia's president. "We're not sure who threw it, but we think it must have been a Ukrainian operative trying to distract us from our military successes."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in Kharkiv, residents are still reeling from the effects of the alleged attack. "I was just walking down the street when suddenly I heard this loud explosion and then... wait for it... ABBA started playing," said one resident, who wished to remain anonymous.<br/><br/>The Russian government has also accused Ukraine of killing 27 people in a New Year's Eve attack on a hotel in occupied Kherson region. But officials say that these claims are merely "propaganda" and that the real reason for the attack was... you guessed it... another disco ball.<br/><br/>"I mean, who needs actual military targets when you have a good dance party?" said a Russian diplomat, with a wink.<br/><br/>In related news, NATO has released a statement saying that they will not be attending any peace talks until the situation in Kharkiv is resolved. But sources close to the alliance say that they are secretly planning a massive disco party to bring everyone together and resolve their differences once and for all.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
