        <p>BREAKING: Seven Elephants Mysteriously Vanish in Assam, Leaving Behind Only a Trail of Confused Passengers and Derailed Trains<br/><br/>In a bizarre incident that has left officials scratching their heads, seven wild Asian elephants were allegedly killed by an express train in the north-eastern state of Assam on Saturday. However, eyewitnesses claim that the elephants simply disappeared into thin air, leaving behind only a faint scent of coffee and a trail of bewildered passengers.<br/><br/>According to reports, the train driver spotted what he thought was a herd of elephants crossing the tracks, but when he hit the emergency brakes, they suddenly turned into a group of accountants from Ernst & Young, who were discussing tax returns. The driver, understandably confused, then proceeded to drive into the non-existent elephants, resulting in a spectacular collision that derailed five carriages and killed seven... well, not exactly elephants.<br/><br/>"It was like nothing I've ever seen before," said a passenger on board. "One minute we're sipping tea and enjoying the scenery, and the next, there's just this massive elephant-shaped hole where they were standing. It was like they vanished into another dimension."<br/><br/>Local officials have since launched an investigation into the incident, but so far, no one has been able to explain what really happened that day.<br/><br/>UPDATE: New Evidence Emerges<br/><br/>In a shocking twist, authorities have discovered that a secret society of ninja pandas had been secretly training in the area and were responsible for manipulating the elephants' disappearance. The pandas, who call themselves "The Panda Clique," have been using their advanced martial arts skills to confuse and mislead wildlife experts for years.<br/><br/>"We've been trying to expose them for ages," said a local wildlife conservationist, "but these sneaky pandas always manage to stay one step ahead."<br/><br/>As the investigation continues, authorities are urging anyone with information about The Panda Clique's nefarious activities to come forward. Meanwhile, the train driver has been placed on paid leave and has been replaced by a team of highly trained hamsters who have successfully completed a rigorous training program in advanced train driving techniques.<br/><br/>related stories<br/><br/>* Pandas Caught Stealing All the World's Donuts<br/>* Elephants Found Hiding Under Beds Around the Globe<br/>* Trains Now Run on Avocado Oil, Sources Say<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
