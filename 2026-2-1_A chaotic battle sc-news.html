        <p>BREAKING: PAKISTANI MILITARY SAYS 31 CIVILIANS AND 17 SECURITY FORCES KILLED IN DEADLY ATTACKS, BUT IT'S ALL GOOD, BECAUSE THEY ALSO KILLED 145 ATTACKERS!<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, the Pakistani military has announced that they've successfully defended themselves against a series of deadly attacks in Balochistan province, killing a whopping 145 attackers. However, in the process, they also managed to kill 31 civilians and 17 security forces personnel. But hey, who's counting?<br/><br/>According to reports, the attacks were carried out by the Balochistan Liberation Army (BLA), a group that's been causing trouble in the region for decades. The BLA claimed responsibility for the attacks, saying they had launched a coordinated operation dubbed "Herof" or "Black Storm". However, it seems like their storm got blown away by the Pakistani military's superior firepower.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses describe the scene as "apocalyptic", with grenades and gunfire causing chaos in cities across Balochistan. "It was like something out of a video game," said one witness. "I mean, I've seen some crazy stuff in my time, but this was on another level."<br/><br/>The Pakistani military, meanwhile, is being hailed as heroes for their bravery in the face of overwhelming odds. "We're not just fighting terrorists, we're fighting for our country's honor and integrity," said a military spokesperson. "And if that means killing 145 people, then so be it!"<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The BLA also claimed to have killed 84 members of the security forces and kidnapped 18 others. However, these claims are being met with skepticism by the Pakistani government, who insist that only a handful of their personnel were actually killed.<br/><br/>As for the civilians who lost their lives in the crossfire, well, let's just say it's all part of the job description when you're fighting against terrorism. "Collateral damage is just a fancy word for 'oops'", said a military spokesperson with a straight face.<br/><br/>In related news, the Indian government has been accused of supporting the BLA, but they've denied any wrongdoing. Meanwhile, the Pakistani Prime Minister has pledged to continue the war against terrorism until its complete eradication... or until the next election, whichever comes first.<br/><br/>And that's not all! The BLA has also accused the Pakistani government of exploiting the rich mineral resources of Balochistan without giving anything back to the local population. But who needs accountability when you're in the middle of a war, right?<br/><br/>In conclusion, it seems like everyone is just trying to outdo each other in this game of "who can kill the most people". And we're all just along for the ride, watching in awe as the death toll rises and the body count grows.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The Pakistani military has announced that they'll be implementing new security measures to prevent future attacks. These include, but are not limited to:<br/><br/>* Mandatory eye-rolling exercises for all soldiers<br/>* Free donuts for everyone involved in the conflict<br/>* A special task force dedicated to finding and eliminating anyone who says "oops"</p>
