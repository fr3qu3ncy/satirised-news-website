        <p>BREAKING: Trump Orders Government to Stop Using Anthropic in Battle Over AI Use<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Donald Trump has directed every federal agency to immediately stop using technology from AI developer Anthropic. And by "immediately," we mean he tweeted about it on Friday morning while eating Cheetos on the golf course.<br/><br/>"I don't need their fancy AI stuff, I've got my own brains and Google," Trump said in a Truth Social post that was equal parts cryptic and grammatically incorrect. "We don't want to do business with them again! They're bad for America!"<br/><br/>The reason for this sudden change of heart? A standoff between Anthropic's boss, Dario Amodei, and the US Department of Defense over the government's demand for unfettered access to Anthropic's AI tools.<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "But wait, isn't Anthropic like a super-smart AI thingy that can do all sorts of cool stuff?" And to that, we say... well, yes. But also, no. Because according to sources close to the matter (i.e., Dario Amodei's cousin, Larry), Anthropic is actually just a bunch of code written by a bunch of hipsters who are trying to save humanity from itself.<br/><br/>Trump's decision came after days of back-and-forth between Anthropic and the Pentagon, during which time Anthropic's CEO, Dario Amodei, was repeatedly asked to agree to give the government "any lawful use" of its AI tools. And by "lawful use," we mean they wanted to use it for things like mass surveillance and fully autonomous weapons.<br/><br/>Amodei, being a reasonable human being (or at least, as reasonable as one can be when dealing with the US military), refused to comply. And so, Trump stepped in to save the day... or at least, to save his own reputation as a tough guy who doesn't take guff from nobody.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Anthropic has been using its AI tools to help the government since 2024, and they've got a contract worth $200 million that they're not going to let go of without a fight. In fact, according to sources (okay, fine, it was Larry Amodei), Anthropic is actually planning to challenge the Pentagon's decision in court... or at least, they are if they can find a lawyer who doesn't mind working for peanuts.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, OpenAI boss Sam Altman has come out in support of Anthropic, saying that he too has "red lines" when it comes to the application of their products. And by "red lines," we mean he's not going to let them be used for anything nefarious... unless there's a lot of money involved.<br/><br/>So, there you have it. Trump vs. Anthropic: The Battle for AI Supremacy. May the best human win!</p>
