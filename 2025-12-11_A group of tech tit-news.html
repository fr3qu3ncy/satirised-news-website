        <p>TIME MAGAZINE TURNS TO TECH TITANS AS "ARCHITECTS OF AI" NAMED PERSON OF THE YEAR - BUT WHO'S REALLY IN CHARGE HERE?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Time Magazine has named a group of tech titans as its Person of the Year, but let's be real, it's really just a bunch of suits in a room making decisions that will change the world (or at least, our daily lives) forever.<br/><br/>The "Architects of AI" - a fancy term for "the guys who created ChatGPT and are now getting rich off of it" - have been given the coveted title, which is really just a nod to their ability to make us all wonder if we're still in control. I mean, who needs a single person as Person of the Year when you can have an entire group of them making decisions behind closed doors?<br/><br/>And what's even more exciting is that this year's cover features none other than Nvidia boss Jensen Huang and Meta head Mark Zuckerberg, both of whom are probably wondering why they didn't get their own personalized hoverboards like Elon Musk did. I mean, it's not like they're just a bunch of billionaires who are changing the world with their fancy AI technology.<br/><br/>According to Time Magazine, this year marks a "tipping point" for how frequently AI is now used in our day-to-day lives - but honestly, I'm still trying to figure out what that means. Is it like when we first got Instagram and suddenly everyone was taking selfies? No, wait, that's not even the same thing.<br/><br/>Anyway, Time Magazine has deemed this group of tech titans as the most influential figures of 2025, which is code for "we're scared of AI and don't know what to do with it." But hey, at least they're trying to make us feel better by putting a bunch of suits on the cover.<br/><br/>And let's not forget about Steve Jobs, who was probably wondering why he didn't get his own personalized time capsule like everyone else. I mean, it's not like he was just a guy who created a computer and changed the world or anything.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks - Time Magazine has named the "Architects of AI" as Person of the Year, which is really just code for "we're all in this together... and by 'together,' I mean we're all trying to figure out how not to get left behind."</p>
