        <p>BREAKING: US Navy Admiral Ordered Second Deadly Venezuela Boat Strike, White House Says<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that a top US Navy admiral ordered a second deadly strike on an alleged Venezuelan drug boat. But this time, it's not just about the boat - it's about the Admiral's love of karaoke.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Admiral Frank Bradley was overheard belting out "I Will Survive" in the officers' mess after his first successful strike on a Venezuelan narco-boat. Insiders claim that Bradley's rendition of the disco classic was so impressive that it inspired him to order another strike - this time, targeting two people who were still clinging to the burning vessel.<br/><br/>"We're not sure what happened to them," said a White House spokesperson. "But we do know that Admiral Bradley was in a state of euphoria after his second strike. He even offered to buy drinks for everyone on board with a rendition of 'Who Let the Dogs Out'."<br/><br/>The second strike has raised fresh legality questions, but the White House is quick to point out that Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth authorized the strikes - and not Admiral Bradley directly. "Hegseth said he didn't order anyone to kill those two men," said the spokesperson. "But what he really meant was that he didn't want them to get a refund on their karaoke lessons."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuelan Attorney General Tarek William Saab has condemned the boat strikes and vowed to carry out a "rigorous and thorough investigation" into the 2 September strikes - but only if they can find a way to watch Netflix.<br/><br/>"I mean, who doesn't love a good Netflix series?" said Saab. "But seriously, folks, we're not going to let the US get away with these blatant human rights abuses. We'll have them know that we've got a special task force - 'Operation: Karaoke-Killers' - dedicated to taking down any US Navy personnel who think they can out-sing us."<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is certain: Admiral Bradley's karaoke skills are under scrutiny like never before.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The US Senate Armed Services Committee has announced that it will be conducting a thorough investigation into the matter - but only if they can have a cake and a coffee break first.</p>
