        <p>SCAM ALERT: Brigitte Bardot's Legacy Hijacked by Scammers<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the lovely legacy of French cinema icon Brigitte Bardot has been hijacked by a group of scoundrels who are trying to make a quick buck off her iconic image. The Brigitte Bardot Foundation has issued a stern warning about these "crude fabrications" that are being peddled online, claiming that the proceeds will go towards her beloved animal welfare charity.<br/><br/>But we all know what's really going on here... it's like a bad sitcom plot: some shady character, probably with a mullet and a mustache, is trying to make a profit off of Brigitte Bardot's good name. I mean, who wouldn't want to cash in on the fame and fortune of one of France's most beloved export? <br/><br/>And let's be real, these scammers are not even trying to hide their tracks. They're like, "Hey, look at me! I'm selling a picture of Brigitte Bardot riding a unicorn while eating a croissant!" Who wouldn't want that?! It's like they're trying to give her fans a collective brain aneurysm.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! The scammers have gone and used AI-assisted montages to create completely fabricated situations featuring Brigitte Bardot. I mean, who needs reality when you can have a Brigitte Bardot riding a unicorn while eating a croissant? It's like they're trying to give her fans a collective existential crisis.<br/><br/>The Brigitte Bardot Foundation is not having it, though. They've issued a stern warning that these scammers will be taken to task if they don't cease and desist immediately. And by "taken to task," I mean they'll probably have to face the wrath of the French authorities, who are not known for their sense of humor.<br/><br/>In related news, Brigitte Bardot's funeral is scheduled to take place on Wednesday in Saint-Tropez, where she will be buried with a giant baguette and a bottle of wine. It's going to be a real party, folks!<br/><br/>And finally, if you're one of these scammers trying to cash in on Brigitte Bardot's legacy, just remember: you can't put a price on dignity, but you can certainly try to sell it online for a few quid.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've received word that the scammers have added a new product to their lineup: Brigitte Bardot playing the harmonica with a team of dolphins. Because, why not?</p>
