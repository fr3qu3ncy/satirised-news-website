        <p>BREAKING: Swiss Bar Fire Turns into a Real-Life Video Game, but with More Flair<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the deadly bar fire in Crans-Montana, Switzerland has been identified as a "party gone wrong" by experts. The blaze, which killed 40 people and injured 119 others, was caused by nothing more than a sparkler being held too close to the ceiling by a group of enthusiastic partygoers.<br/><br/>"It's like someone took the script from 'The Hangover' and decided to make it real," said a local resident, still in shock. "I mean, who needs a plot twist when you can just have a bunch of people running around with sparklers?"<br/><br/>Among the victims was 16-year-old Swiss national Arthur Brodard, whose mother confirmed his passing on Facebook. When asked about her son's love for partying, she simply said, "He loved to let loose and have fun... until he didn't."<br/><br/>The investigation into the fire has revealed that the French couple who owned the bar, Jacques and Jessica Moretti, are being investigated for manslaughter by negligence, bodily harm by negligence, and arson by negligence. When asked about their culpability, a spokesperson for the prosecutor's office said, "Let's just say they're not getting any participation trophies."<br/><br/>As news of the fire spread, social media was flooded with people sharing their own party horror stories. One Twitter user shared a photo of himself trying to put out a small fire in his kitchen while wearing a pair of slippers and a tutu. Another Instagram user posted a video of themselves attempting to "rescue" a friend from a burning building while doing a backflip off the stairs.<br/><br/>In related news, the Italian Golf Federation has confirmed that junior golfer Emanuele Galeppini was one of the victims. When asked about his love for golf, his father replied, "He loved golf... but also loved partying... and sparklers."<br/><br/>The Swiss government has announced a national day of mourning on January 9th, during which people are encouraged to stay indoors, wear their pajamas, and watch reruns of 'The Simpsons' while eating Cinnamon Toast Crunch cereal.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
