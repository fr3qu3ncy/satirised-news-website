        <p>BREAKING: Iran's Supreme Leader Declares Protesters "A Bunch of Vandals"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Iran's Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has branded anti-government protesters as "a bunch of vandals" just trying to please Donald Trump. Yes, you read that right – the Donald.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Ayatollah (okay, maybe not so close), Khamenei made this bold statement in a televised address on Friday, while flanked by his trusty sidekicks, Elvis Presley and Big Bird. We're not sure what's more surprising – the fact that Elvis is suddenly alive and well, or that he's now working as a government advisor.<br/><br/>The protests, which have been going on for 13 days, began with shopkeepers in Tehran complaining about the collapsing currency. But things quickly escalated when protesters started chanting "Death to the Dictator" – referencing Khamenei, not the McDonald's chicken nuggets they were really after.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Reza Pahlavi, the son of Iran's last shah (who we're pretty sure is still stuck in a 1970s time warp), has called on Trump to "be prepared to intervene to help the people of Iran." Because what the Middle East needs right now is another American-led intervention – said no one ever.<br/><br/>The protests have left at least 48 protesters dead, and over 2,277 individuals arrested. But hey, who's counting? At least the internet blackout has given everyone a chance to catch up on their Netflix shows (we hear "Stranger Things" is still going strong).<br/><br/>In related news, Trump has warned Iran that if it kills more protesters, the US will "hit" the country "very hard." Because, you know, the best way to resolve international conflicts is with a good ol' fashioned punch in the face.<br/><br/>And finally, because we couldn't make this up even if we tried – a group of protesters in Tehran has started a petition to have Big Bird declared as their new leader. Who wouldn't want that?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story – or not, because who needs news when you've got Netflix?</p>
