        <p>Breaking News: Travelator Travesty<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a five-year-old boy in Japan has been pronounced dead after getting his arm caught on a travelator at the Asarigawa Onsen Ski Resort. But wait, it gets even better!<br/><br/>As the staff at the resort tried to rescue the little guy, they realized that the safety mechanism on the travelator was not working properly... and by "not working properly," we mean it had been put in storage for a quick game of Mario Kart with the janitor. Whoops!<br/><br/>The team of highly trained professionals (okay, it was just two guys named Bob and Larry) spent a whopping 40 minutes dismantling part of the travelator to free the poor kid. Unfortunately, by that time, he had already fallen unconscious from sheer boredom.<br/><br/>"We're very sorry about this whole situation," said the resort's manager, while trying to hide his embarrassment behind a giant novelty moustache. "But hey, at least we got some great footage for our new viral video: 'Travelator Travesty 2025'!"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, police are investigating the incident and have already identified the prime suspect: the travelator itself. "It's clear that this was an inside job," said Detective Bob. "I mean, who needs human victims when you can just catch arms on a conveyor belt?"<br/><br/>In related news, the Japanese government has announced plans to implement stricter safety protocols at all ski resorts across the country. Specifically, they will be installing more travelators and hiring more staff with questionable work ethic.<br/><br/>As for Hinata Goto's family, they are still trying to come to terms with their loss. "We're just glad that we got to take some awesome Instagram photos of our son on a conveyor belt," said his mother, while uploading the pictures online.</p>
