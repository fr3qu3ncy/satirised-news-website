        <p>**BREAKING: Japan's One Piece Singer Interrupted Mid-Song, Prompting Meme-Fest and International Outrage**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Japanese pop sensation Maki Otsuki was abruptly interrupted mid-performance at a Shanghai music festival on Friday. The incident has sparked widespread criticism, with fans taking to social media to express their outrage.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Otsuki was singing the theme song from hit anime One Piece when suddenly, the lights and music stopped, and she was whisked away by two burly crew members. It's been reported that the performance was cancelled due to "unavoidable circumstances," but sources close to the event have revealed that it was actually because of a directive from Beijing's foreign ministry.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, pop icon Ayumi Hamasaki performed to an empty 14,000-seat stadium on Saturday, after organisers axed her concert in Shanghai citing "force majeure." It's believed that Hamasaki decided to go ahead with the performance as a way of showing solidarity with her fans and the Japanese community.<br/><br/>The incident has sparked a meme-fest on social media, with fans comparing Otsuki's interrupted performance to the infamous removal of China's former leader Hu Jintao during a Communist Party meeting in October 2022. The hashtag #HuJintaoTreatment is trending globally, with many calling for an end to China's strict censorship policies.<br/><br/>George Glass, the United States' ambassador to Japan, weighed in on the controversy, saying, "It's truly regrettable that there are people who can't feel the power of music." He went on to quote Journey's iconic hit song Don't Stop Believin', adding, "Maki-san, Don't Stop Believin'—keep holding on to your convictions!"<br/><br/>However, not everyone is buying into the meme-fest. Some Chinese social media users are defending Beijing's actions, saying that Japan's Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi made inflammatory comments about Taiwan, sparking diplomatic tensions between the two nations.<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, one thing is clear: the world is watching with bated breath as this international drama plays out. Will Maki Otsuki be able to recover from this setback? And will Ayumi Hamasaki's decision to perform in an empty stadium inspire a new wave of Japanese pop stars to stand up for their fans and the art of music?<br/><br/>Only time will tell, but one thing is certain: this incident has sparked a global conversation about censorship, freedom of expression, and the power of music to bring people together.<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** CMAT, Fontaines D.C., and Gorillaz have been announced as headliners for Electric Picnic 2026. Ozzy Osbourne's cultural impact will be celebrated with an award from Birmingham's Lord Mayor. Jorja Smith performed at Radio One's Big Weekend in 2025.<br/><br/>**related articles:**<br/><br/>* Death toll in Indonesia floods passes 500<br/>* Musk says H-1B visas being 'gamed' by outsourcing firms<br/>* Over 120,000 home cameras hacked in South Korea for 'sexploitation' footage</p>
