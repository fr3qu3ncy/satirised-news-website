        <h2>France Enshrines in Law the End of Conjugal Rights, Because Who Needs Sex in Marriage Anyway?</h2>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>France has passed a bill abolishing "conjugal rights" from marriage laws, essentially making sex optional in relationships and freeing couples to binge-watch Netflix together instead of each other.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: France Enshrines in Law the End of Conjugal Rights, Because Who Needs Sex in Marriage Anyway?<br/><br/>In a bold move to shake off the shackles of traditional marriage, France has approved a bill that abolishes the concept of conjugal rights – aka the notion that marriage means a duty to have sex. And honestly, who needs all that drama and obligation in a relationship, am I right?<br/><br/>The proposed law, which was passed with flying colors in the National Assembly on Wednesday, adds a clause to the country's civil code stating that "community of living" does not create an "obligation for sexual relations." Ah, freedom! Because let's be real, who needs sex when you've got Netflix and pizza?<br/><br/>Supporters of the bill, including Green MP Marie-Charlotte Garin, claim it will help deter marital rape. And honestly, that's just a fancy way of saying "marital booty call," right? By abolishing conjugal rights, France is basically telling couples that they're free to have as much or as little sex as they want – or don't want – without fear of reprisal.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The law also makes it impossible for judges to use lack of sexual relations as an argument in fault-based divorce. Because who needs a good excuse for getting out of a marriage, anyway?<br/><br/>The origins of this notion lie in medieval church law, which basically said that husbands had the right to their wives' bodies at all times. Yeah, because nothing says "romance" like a healthy dose of patriarchy.<br/><br/>In a famous case in 2019, a woman was found to have withheld sex from her husband for several years, and he was granted a fault-based divorce implying guilt on her part. But she didn't take it lying down, folks! She took her case to the European Court of Human Rights (ECHR), which condemned France for allowing refusal of sex to be grounds for a fault-based divorce.<br/><br/>And that's when things got real interesting. The ECHR's decision has made it practically impossible for any French divorce judge to make a similar ruling – aka, husbands can't just blame their wives for not putting out anymore.<br/><br/>But the real magic happens in 2024, when a woman named Gisèle Pelicot was repeatedly raped by men invited by her husband. Because, you know, that's exactly what you want in a marriage: a good ol' fashioned gang bang!<br/><br/>The defendants claimed they assumed her consent because of what her husband had told them – aka, "he said she was cool with it." But we all know how that turns out.<br/><br/>Since November last year, the legal definition of rape in France has also been expanded to include the notion of non-consent. Because, you know, silence or an absence of reaction do not imply consent. Unless, of course, it's a guy who doesn't get what he wants – then suddenly everyone's an expert on consent!<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! France is leading the charge in abolishing conjugal rights and making marriage all about friendship and Netflix binges. Who's next?</p>
