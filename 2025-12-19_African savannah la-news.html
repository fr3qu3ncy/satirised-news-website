        <p>BREAKING: South Africa Accused of Using Kenyan Maasai Warriors Without Work Permits to Process Refugee Applications<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has accused South Africa of employing Kenyan Maasai warriors without work permits to process refugee applications from white South Africans seeking asylum in the US. The US claims that these Maasai warriors were not only working without proper documentation but were also drinking elephant-sized cups of tea and playing loud music while on the job.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter, the Kenyan Maasai warriors, known for their expertise in fighting lions and looking cool while doing it, were brought in by South African officials to work at a refugee processing center. However, when questioned about the lack of work permits, the South Africans responded by saying, "Oh, they're just interns. They're learning the ropes."<br/><br/>The US has threatened to impose severe consequences on South Africa for its alleged transgressions, including but not limited to: withholding American reality TV shows from South African audiences, denying them access to McDonald's restaurants, and forcing them to watch an endless loop of Nicolas Cage movies.<br/><br/>In response to the US accusations, a spokesperson for the South African government said, "We're shocked, SHOCKED, that the US would make such baseless claims. I mean, who needs work permits when you've got a good excuse for drinking tea all day?" When asked about the presence of Maasai warriors at the refugee processing center, they replied, "Oh, those guys? They're just our new IT department. Yeah, that's it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the Kenyan Maasai warriors involved in the alleged scandal have issued a statement saying, "We were just trying to make some extra cash by doing some freelance work on the side. And by 'freelance work,' I mean fighting lions and looking cool while doing it. But hey, a bird's gotta eat, right?"<br/><br/>The US has vowed to continue investigating this matter further, with Secretary of State Mike Pompeo stating, "We will not rest until we get to the bottom of this Maasai warrior refugee processing scandal. And by 'get to the bottom,' I mean find out who ate all the donuts in the break room."<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a bizarre twist, it has been revealed that the US is planning to send a team of ninja warriors to South Africa to conduct a stealthy investigation into the alleged scandal. When asked about this development, a spokesperson for the South African government simply shrugged and said, "Oh, those guys? They're just our new pizza delivery service."</p>
