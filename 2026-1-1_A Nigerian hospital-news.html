        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>ANTHONY JOSHUA DISCHARGED FROM HOSPITAL AFTER NIGERIA CAR CRASH, BUT THINGS JUST GOT WEIRDER<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, former world champion Anthony Joshua has been discharged from hospital in Nigeria after a fatal car accident that killed two of his close friends. But wait, it gets better! As he was leaving the hospital, Joshua was stopped by a group of mariachi dancers who were performing a choreographed routine to a Michael Jackson song. They insisted on taking a selfie with him, and things only got weirder from there.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, Joshua's friends Sina Ghami and Latif "Latz" Ayodele (who died in the accident) had been planning a surprise party for his 37th birthday, complete with a cake shaped like a giant boxing glove. However, due to unforeseen circumstances, the party was cancelled, and instead of celebrating Joshua's birthday, they ended up being part of a car crash that killed them both.<br/><br/>As Joshua visited the funeral home where their bodies were being prepared for repatriation, he couldn't help but think about how this whole situation was like something out of a bad sitcom. "I mean, I've had some crazy fights in my career," Joshua said in an interview, "but this is just ridiculous. Next thing you know, they'll be asking me to do a comedy special with Dave Chappelle."<br/><br/>The Nigerian police have launched an investigation into the accident, which has been deemed a "highly unusual and unfortunate incident." When asked for comment, the police spokesperson simply said, "We're still trying to figure out how this all happened. But let's just say it's not exactly a case of 'Foul play' – more like 'Foul driving'."<br/><br/>In related news, Joshua's promoter Eddie Hearn has announced plans to release a new line of merchandise featuring the slogan "Joshua 4 Life" – which is being marketed as a tribute to his friends who died in the accident. When asked about the decision, Hearn simply said, "Hey, someone's gotta make money from this situation."<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>As Joshua was leaving the hospital, he was stopped by a group of tourists on a guided tour of the local area. One of them, a young woman from New York, approached him and said, "Excuse me, sir, can I take a selfie with you? My grandma loves Anthony Joshua!" Joshua smiled and obliged, but not before asking her to send his best regards to her grandma – along with a request for a signed copy of her favorite book by Danielle Steel.<br/><br/>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the United Nations has issued an official statement condemning the car crash as "a clear example of what happens when people drive recklessly in Africa." When asked for comment, a spokesperson for the UN simply said, "We're working on a new report titled 'The Dangers of Driving in Nigeria: A Case Study'."<br/><br/>AND FINALLY<br/><br/>As Joshua was driving away from the hospital, he received an emergency call from his agent. "Tony, it's me," said the agent. "I just got word that you've been invited to perform at the annual 'Dancing with the Stars' gala in Los Angeles. Are you available?"<br/><br/>Joshua thought for a moment before responding. "Hold on, mate. I think I've got something better planned – like maybe learning how to play the harmonica."<br/><br/>This is not a drill!</p>
