        <p>BREAKING: Politicians in the Faroe Islands Just Decided to Get Abortions, Too<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the politicians in the self-governing Danish territory have voted to overturn legislation which banned abortion in most cases. Because, let's be real, who needs laws when you've got a bunch of politicians making decisions for everyone else?<br/><br/>The new law, which comes into effect on July 1st next year (just in time for summer), allows abortions until the end of the 12th week of pregnancy. Which is just enough time to get an abortion and then still have time to enjoy the beautiful Faroese landscape before the baby gets too big.<br/><br/>"I'm thrilled that our politicians have finally come to their senses," said a spokesperson for the pro-choice campaign group Fritt Val, who were instrumental in getting the law changed. "Now, instead of just having to travel to Denmark for an abortion, our women can stay here and enjoy the scenic views while they're waiting."<br/><br/>But not everyone is happy about this decision. Erhard Joensen, an MP who voted against the bill, said he's "disappointed but not surprised" by the result. "I mean, it's not like we have better things to do than make laws that allow people to get abortions," he sighed.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ingilín Didriksen Strømm, one of the four MPs who tabled the bill, was over the moon with the decision. "This is truly an historic day in the Faroe Islands!" she exclaimed. "And by 'historic', I mean it's going to take a while for us all to get used to the fact that we're now more like Denmark and less like a bunch of old-fashioned Scandinavians."<br/><br/>Related News:<br/><br/>* New law says politicians can only get abortions if they've been married for at least five years<br/>* Pro-choice campaigners in the Shetland Islands are planning a protest against the new law, which they claim is "too restrictive"<br/>* Meanwhile, the Scottish government has announced plans to introduce a new law that allows politicians to have as many abortions as they want, as long as they're wearing their tartan kilts<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story.</p>
