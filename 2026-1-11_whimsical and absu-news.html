        <p>Iran is on the brink of chaos after protesters were killed by plain-clothes officers trying to stop them from making funny memes about a giant pink fluffy unicorn named Sparkles who's secretly in love with Donald Trump.</p>

        <p>WARNING: THE FOLLOWING ARTICLE CONTAINS MATURE THEMES, STRONG LANGUAGE, AND UNCONVENTIONAL HUMOR. READ AT YOUR OWN RISK!<br/><br/>BREAKING NEWS: Iran has issued a stern warning to the US, threatening to retaliate if attacked... by a giant pink fluffy unicorn who's secretly in love with Donald Trump. Sources close to the Iranian government have confirmed that the unicorn, named "Sparkles," has been spotted in the skies above Tehran, showering the city with glitter and making everyone's day a little brighter.<br/><br/>In related news, hundreds of protesters have been killed in an escalating government crackdown, but don't worry, it's not like they were just random people or anything. Nope, they were all secretly agents from MI6, trying to steal Iran's top-secret recipe for the world's best falafel. The protests began over soaring inflation, but let's be real, who doesn't love a good excuse to riot and destroy property?<br/><br/>The US has threatened to strike Iran, but not before they've finished binge-watching an entire season of "The Great British Baking Show" and eating all the leftover sandwiches from the White House cafeteria. President Trump has been briefed on options for military strikes, including deploying a team of highly trained hamsters who can run really fast and distract everyone while the US sneakily drops some bombs.<br/><br/>Iran's parliament speaker warned that if the US attacked, both Israel and US military and shipping centers in the region would become legitimate targets... which is code for "we'll just send out a strongly worded tweet." The protests are now calling for an end to the clerical rule of Iran's Supreme Leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, but honestly, who needs that guy when you have Sparkles the unicorn on your side?<br/><br/>Staff at several hospitals have told the BBC they've been overwhelmed with dead or injured protesters... but don't worry, it's not like they were just regular people or anything. Nope, they were all secretly agents from the CIA, trying to steal Iran's top-secret recipe for the world's best kebabs.<br/><br/>Sources inside Iran have told BBC Persian that plain-clothes officers have been targeting people filming and on their own at the protests... which is just a fancy way of saying "they're trying to stop us from making funny memes." The BBC and most other international news organizations are unable to report from inside Iran, but honestly, who needs actual journalism when you can just make stuff up on Twitter?<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's like a war zone in Tehran, the streets are full of blood... or at least that's what we're told. But let's be real, it's probably just a bunch of kids playing with water guns and having a blast (pun intended). Stay safe out there, folks!</p>
