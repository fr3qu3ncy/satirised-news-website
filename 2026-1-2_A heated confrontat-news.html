        <p>BREAKING: "We're Not Mad, We're Just Really, Really Upset": US President Trump Warns Iran to Stop Killing Protesters<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has issued a stern warning to the Iranian government to stop killing peaceful protesters. And by "stern", we mean he tweeted it with a few typos and some emojis.<br/><br/>"Iran, don't be bad! 🤪 If you kill those nice protesters, we'll come to their rescue 💁‍♀️ (just kidding, we're not really going to do anything, but still...). We're locked and loaded, ready to go! 🔴⚡️" Trump tweeted on Friday.<br/><br/>But it's not just Iran that's taking note of Trump's warning. The Iranian government has responded by saying, "Oh no, you mean business? 😳 We were just messing with you, Mr. President."<br/><br/>In reality, at least eight people have been killed in Iran after days of mass protests sparked by worsening economic conditions. And by "mass protests", we mean a bunch of angry people running around and breaking some stuff.<br/><br/>Trump's warning comes as the US is already locked in a heated dispute with Iran over its nuclear program. But hey, who needs diplomacy when you can just tweet about it?<br/><br/>"We're Not Going to Let You Get Away with This, Iran!": Trump's Secretary of State, Larry King (not that one), Speaks Out<br/><br/>"We're not going to let Iran get away with killing all those protesters," said Larry King, Trump's Secretary of State. "I mean, we're not really sure what we'll do about it, but we'll definitely think about it."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Iranian officials have been quick to respond to Trump's warning. "We're not afraid of the US," said an Iranian government spokesperson. "In fact, we're so not afraid that we're going to start a new trend: 'Tehran Tantrums' 🤯"<br/><br/>And if all else fails, there's always the option of... wait for it... Elon Musk stepping in to resolve the conflict.<br/><br/>"I'll just tweet at them and they'll calm down," said Musk. "It's like magic, folks."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story! 🚨<br/><br/>"What's Going On?": The BBC's North America Correspondent, Anthony Zurcher, Weighs In<br/><br/>"Well, it looks like the US is getting involved in Iran's internal affairs," said Zurcher. "But honestly, we're not really sure what that means or why anyone should care."<br/><br/>"Why Should I Care?": The BBC's North America Correspondent, Anthony Zurcher (again), Explains<br/><br/>"Well, it's like this: the US is trying to be cool and show off its military might. And Iran is all like 'Oh no you didn't!'... just kidding, we're not really sure what they're saying either."<br/><br/>"What's Next?": The BBC's North America Correspondent, Anthony Zurcher (for real this time)<br/><br/>"Who knows? Maybe Trump will start a Twitter fight with Putin and we'll all be like 'What's going on?' again. 🤯 Stay tuned, folks!"<br/><br/>And that's the latest from the US-Iran drama. Or should we say...
