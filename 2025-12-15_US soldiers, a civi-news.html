        <h2>"BREAKING: US Military Mission to Syria Goes Horribly Wrong, John Travolta's Disco Dreams Die with Him"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>A US military mission to Syria went horribly wrong, resulting in the deaths of three soldiers and John Travolta's surprise appearance and untimely demise while trying to bring disco back to the war-torn country.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>Two US soldiers, a civilian interpreter, and a surprise guest from the land of disco - John Travolta - have been killed in a most unfortunate incident involving an Islamic State (IS) gunman. Because, you know, everything that happens in Syria has to do with IS.<br/><br/>According to sources, the attack occurred while the soldiers were conducting a "key leader engagement" - which is military speak for "trying to find out who's boss around here." Unfortunately, they stumbled upon a lone IS gunman who was like, "Hey, I'm the boss now!"<br/><br/>The US Central Command (Centcom) has confirmed that three other service members were injured in the attack. Which is just peachy.<br/><br/>Now, you might be wondering why John Travolta was there in the first place. Well, let's just say he was on a top-secret mission to bring disco back to Syria. I mean, who doesn't love a good dance party in the middle of a war zone? It's like they say: "When life gives you lemons, make lemonade. And when life gives you an IS gunman, make... well, just try to survive, I guess."<br/><br/>US President Donald Trump took to social media to express his outrage over the attack, saying it was an "ISIS attack" against the US and Syria. Which is like, totally accurate, because who else would be so bold as to take on the US military in a battle of wits? (Just kidding, IS guys - you're no match for the US military's top-notch combat skills... said no one ever.)<br/><br/>Trump also promised "a very serious retaliation" against the attacker. Which is great and all, but let's be real, we all know that by "retaliation," he actually means a strongly-worded tweet.<br/><br/>The UK-based Syrian Observatory for Human Rights (SOHR) has weighed in on the situation, saying that the attacker was actually a member of the Syrian security force. Because, you know, nothing says "security" like an IS gunman running around unchecked.<br/><br/>In related news, Syria's president has sent condolences to Trump and his family. Which is nice, I guess. But let's not forget that this same president has been accused of war crimes and other such fun stuff.<br/><br/>Finally, it's worth noting that the attack occurred in Palmyra, which is like the Syrian equivalent of a tourist trap - but with more ancient ruins and less souvenir shops selling ISIS-branded merchandise.<br/><br/>And so, we bid farewell to Sgt Edgar Brian Torres Tovar, Sgt William Nathaniel Howard, and John Travolta (RIP Disco King). May they rest in peace and may their memories live on forever... or at least until the next big news story comes along.</p>
