        <p>BREAKING: ISIS Attacker Wears Clown Shoes to Ambush US Troops, Mistakenly Targets Tourist in Sightseeing Bus<br/><br/>In a bizarre and hilarious turn of events, two US soldiers and a civilian interpreter were killed in an ambush by an Islamic State (ISIS) gunman in Syria. But here's the kicker - the attacker was wearing bright red clown shoes, which somehow managed to distract everyone from the fact that he was actually a failed magician trying to make a comeback.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the ISIS gunman, who had been seen performing magic tricks at a local children's birthday party just hours before, suddenly appeared on the scene in his ridiculous clown getup and shouted "Ta-da!" as he opened fire. Unfortunately for him, one of the US soldiers was actually a former magician himself and quickly retaliated with a well-placed water balloon.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad sitcom," said General John Smith, who witnessed the entire debacle from a nearby hummus bar. "I mean, I've seen some weird things in my time, but this takes the cake."<br/><br/>The US military has issued a statement saying that they are investigating the incident and have ordered an immediate review of their training programs to include more clown-themed self-defense scenarios.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, ISIS leaders have been quick to condemn the attack, citing it as a "grave mistake" on the part of their lone gunman. "We apologize for the inconvenience caused by our failure to properly screen our members for clown shoes," said a spokesperson for the group. "It's not like we're trying to be funny or anything."<br/><br/>In other news, the Syrian government has issued a statement saying that they condemn the attack and are offering a reward for information leading to the capture of the ISIS gunman, who is still at large and wearing his clown shoes.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The US military has announced that they will be replacing their standard issue combat boots with clown shoes as a way to "add some much-needed levity" to their operations.</p>
