        <p>BREAKING: Venezuela Denounces Trump's "Ghost Ship" Blockade as 'Epic Fail'<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Venezuela has denounced US President Donald Trump's order for a blockade on all sanctioned oil tankers entering and leaving the country as "epic fail". The move comes after Trump wrote that Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro's government had been designated a foreign terrorist organisation (FTO), which had also engaged in "Drug Smuggling, and Human Trafficking" - a claim that was met with widespread laughter by Venezuelans.<br/><br/>The blockade, which Trump described as a "total and complete" measure, is being enforced by a flotilla of tiny sailboats piloted by the cast of "The Love Boat". The US military has also deployed a team of highly trained hamsters to sniff out any potential smuggling vessels. However, sources close to the Venezuelan government have revealed that these hamsters are actually just furry little thieves in disguise.<br/><br/>Trump's post on Truth Social did not give further detail of how the wide-ranging blockade on sanctioned oil tankers would be enforced, but it did include a selfie of him with a giant sandwich board reading "Venezuela: We're Watching You (and Stealing Your Oil)".<br/><br/>As of last week, more than 30 of the 80 ships in Venezuelan waters or approaching the country were under US sanctions, according to data compiled by TankerTrackers.com. However, sources close to the Venezuelan government have revealed that these sanctioned tankers are actually just ships carrying a cargo of disco records and polyester suits.<br/><br/>Multiple new US sanctions on ships said to be carrying Venezuelan oil were issued after the tanker was seized, but they were quickly revoked when it was discovered that the vessels in question were actually just party boats carrying a crew of enthusiastic line dancers.<br/><br/>Sanctions were also placed on some of President Maduro's relatives and on businesses associated with what the US called his illegitimate regime. However, these sanctions were later lifted when it was revealed that one of the sanctioned businesses was actually just a giant piñata factory.<br/><br/>In response to Trump's actions, Venezuela has accused Washington of seeking to steal its resources - specifically, a large shipment of nacho cheese Doritos. The US government has denied any wrongdoing, but sources close to the Venezuelan government have revealed that the shipment is actually just a cover for a secret plot to steal all the world's supply of salsa.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>In an unrelated story, it has been reported that the cast of "The Love Boat" has been called in to perform an emergency rescue mission after Trump's blockade was discovered to be ineffective. The crew of the SS Love Boat will attempt to salvage a cargo ship carrying a load of essential nacho cheese supplies.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS EPIC FAIL!<br/><br/>(Note: this article is entirely fictional and intended for comedic purposes only)</p>
