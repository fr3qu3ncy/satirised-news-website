        <p>BREAKING: Dubai Chewy Cookie Pandemonium Hits South Korea<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the usually tranquil streets of Seoul have been transformed into a war zone – not over politics or food prices, but over something far more sinister: the coveted Dubai chewy cookie. This unassuming treat, inspired by the emirate's own chocolate confection, has taken South Korean bakeries and snack shops by storm.<br/><br/>"It's like they're trying to steal our kimchi!" exclaimed Park Ji-hyun, owner of a popular Seoul bakery. "We can barely keep up with demand – it's like they're hoarding all the cookies for themselves!"<br/><br/>But it's not just individual bakers who are feeling the pinch. The entire nation has been gripped by cookie fever, with prices skyrocketing and shortages reported across the country.<br/><br/>"I tried to buy 50 of them last week," said Seoul resident Kim Tae-yong. "But they told me I could only get 10 – that's just not enough for a guy like me!"<br/><br/>And it gets worse: online black markets are now thriving, with counterfeiters cashing in on the cookie craze by peddling subpar knockoffs.<br/><br/>"Don't even think about buying from them," warned one exasperated consumer. "I got scammed out of 20,000 won on a 'genuine' Dubai chewy cookie that turned out to be just a plain chocolate chip cookie with some soggy marshmallow bits stuck on top."<br/><br/>But who's behind this cookie chaos? Experts point fingers at none other than Jang Won-young, the pop star from girl band Ive, who first sparked the trend last September.<br/><br/>"It was like she declared war on our snack supplies," said a disbelieving baker. "One minute we're making kimchi and bibimbap, the next thing you know, everyone's talking about Dubai chewy cookies!"<br/><br/>As the nation teeters on the brink of cookie-induced madness, authorities are scrambling to establish order – but it may already be too late.<br/><br/>"I heard they're introducing a new cookie-to- citizen ratio," joked one exasperated Seoul resident. "If we're not careful, South Korea will be overrun with Dubai chewy cookies within weeks!"<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news:<br/><br/>* A group of rogue pandas were spotted attempting to steal a batch of freshly baked cookies from a bakery in Beijing.<br/>* The world's largest cookie jar was unveiled in New York City, sparking concerns about the impact on global sugar supplies.<br/>* Experts warn that the Dubai chewy cookie craze may be just the beginning – what's next?
