        <p>BREAKING: Belarus Frees 123 Prisoners, Including Maria Kolesnikova, as Donald Trump's Special Envoy John Coale Works His Magic<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the authorities in Belarus have released 123 political prisoners, including the infamous protest leader Maria Kolesnikova, after being held captive for over five years. And to make matters even more surreal, the release is credited to none other than Donald Trump's special envoy, John Coale, who somehow managed to convince the US government to lift sanctions on Belarus.<br/><br/>"It's like winning the lottery... or getting a free pizza from Domino's," Maria Kolesnikova exclaimed in a post-release interview, her iconic red lips gleaming with excitement. "I mean, what more could you ask for? Freedom and a chance to go back to my old routine of protesting against the government?"<br/><br/>But not everyone is celebrating. Viktor Babaryka, a banker who was also released from prison, couldn't hide his disappointment. "I was hoping to get a better deal on my mortgage after being locked up for so long," he said in a statement.<br/><br/>Ales Bialiatski, the Nobel Peace Prize winner and another prisoner released in this surprise move, was spotted wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and dancing to disco music outside the US embassy. When asked about his plans now that he's free, he replied, "I'm going to eat a whole pizza by myself... I mean, reunite with my wife."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Maria Kolesnikova is said to be heading straight to her favorite restaurant in Vilnius, Lithuania, where she will celebrate her release with a feast of pierogies and borscht.<br/><br/>The US government has confirmed that the sanctions were lifted in exchange for Belarus releasing 123 prisoners, but it remains unclear what exactly Donald Trump got out of this deal. "It's like trading a Ferrari for a toaster," one insider quipped.<br/><br/>As the released prisoners make their way to various destinations across Europe, they are being met with cheering crowds and waves of fans brandishing giant flags. The hashtag #BelarusPrisonersAreFree is trending on social media, with many people celebrating the release as a major victory against authoritarian rule.<br/><br/>But not everyone is convinced that this is a good thing. "It's just another example of how the US will do anything to get its hands on Belarusian potash," said one critic. "I mean, who needs freedom when you can have cheap fertilizer?"<br/><br/>In related news, Alexander Lukashenko has been spotted smiling and giving thumbs-ups in front of the Belarusian flag, while Donald Trump is reportedly considering running a line of new merchandise featuring his signature phrase: "Belarusians are great... believe me."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
