        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Military Build-Up Baffles Iran, But Not His Hair<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump has expressed his confusion as to why Iran hasn't "capitulated" yet in the face of his impressive military build-up. Because, you know, nothing says "diplomacy" like a bunch of fighter jets and warships.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (or at least that's what we're told), Trump's special envoy Steve Witkoff has been trying to get Iran to surrender by saying things like, "Hey, Iran, come on over and let's talk about this nuclear thingy. We've got a great deal for you, it's gonna be yuge!" But so far, no luck.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in the States, Trump's hair is still looking fabulous, even amidst all the tension with Iran. It's like he's saying, "I don't know what you're talking about, Iran, but my coiffure is still on point."<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! In related news, protests have broken out in Tehran, with students marching through the streets and chanting slogans that roughly translate to "Long live the king... of memes." Who knew Iran had such a great sense of humor?<br/><br/>And just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder, reports emerged that Trump had been spotted at Mar-a-Lago, his favorite country club, where he was seen sipping margaritas and talking about the importance of golf. Because, priorities.<br/><br/>US Military Build-Up: A Timeline<br/><br/>* 2026: The US starts building up its military presence near Iran.<br/>* 2026 (cont'd): Trump gets confused as to why Iran hasn't surrendered yet.<br/>* 2026 (still cont'd): Protests break out in Tehran, with students chanting slogans and burning US flags.
