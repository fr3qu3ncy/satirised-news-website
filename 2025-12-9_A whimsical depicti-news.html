        <p>BREAKING: Belarusian Leader Alexander Lukashenko Caught Smuggling Cigarettes in Weather Balloons, Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene Loses Mind<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Lithuanian Prime Minister Inga Ruginiene has declared a nationwide emergency situation after discovering that the neighboring country of Belarus is using weather balloons to smuggle cigarettes into Lithuania. Yes, you read that right - weather balloons.<br/><br/>According to sources, thousands of these balloons have been spotted flying over Lithuanian airspace, carrying contraband packets of cigarettes and causing chaos at Vilnius airport. The situation has become so dire that the airport has had to shut down multiple times due to "unforeseen circumstances" involving sheep on a runway.<br/><br/>"We are talking about aviation security and international law here," Ruginiene said in a statement, her face red with rage. "And also about the fact that such actions could be recognised as terrorism... by my cat."<br/><br/>But Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko has come out swinging, denying any involvement in the cigarette-smuggling scheme and blaming Lithuania for politicizing the issue. "It's unrealistic," he said on live TV. "Even if balloons flew into there, even if they did, I have spoken to pilots and they say that they pose no problem... unless you're a sheep trying to cross the runway."<br/><br/>As tensions rise between the two nations, officials are scrambling to respond to the crisis. The Lithuanian military has been deployed to shoot down any more balloons, while Belarus has retaliated by blocking Lithuanian trucks from entering its territory.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Vilnius airport has become a hotbed of activity as passengers wait in line to board flights - but only after they've finished playing with the sheep on the runway. "It's all about the experience," said one passenger. "We're not just flying from point A to point B, we're also getting to know some lovely sheep."<br/><br/>The situation is expected to escalate further as the European Union prepares to send a team of experts to mediate the conflict. But until then, it's business as usual for the sheep on the runway.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>* Lithuania has imposed a national curfew, during which all residents must remain indoors and watch reruns of cat videos.<br/>* Belarus has threatened to blockade all major ports in Europe unless its demand for more cigarettes is met.<br/>* The European Union has announced plans to establish a new department dedicated solely to monitoring the activities of sheep on runways.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates as this developing story continues to unfold!</p>
