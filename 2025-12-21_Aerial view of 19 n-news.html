        <p>ISRAEL APPROVES 19 NEW SETTLEMENTS IN OCCUPIED WEST BANK, BECAUSE WHO NEEDS PEACE AND QUIET WHEN YOU CAN HAVE A PARTY?<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the world scratching its head, Israel's security cabinet has approved the recognition of 19 new settlements in the occupied West Bank. Because, you know, who needs a two-state solution when you can have a bunch of new settlers to throw into the mix?<br/><br/>Far-right Finance Minister Bezalel Smotrich, a settler himself (because it's just more fun that way), proposed the move alongside Defence Minister Israel Katz, and said the decision was about blocking the establishment of a Palestinian state. Yeah, because nothing says "peace" like a bunch of Israeli settlers in bulldozers.<br/><br/>Saudi Arabia condemned the move, but we're pretty sure they were just jealous of all the cool new settlements they could've had if only they'd approved them first. UN Secretary-General Antonio Guterres has said Israel's "relentless" settlement expansion fuels tensions, restricts Palestinian access to land, and threatens the viability of a sovereign Palestinian state. Oh no, what will we do without another place to put our IKEA furniture?<br/><br/>Violence in the occupied West Bank has surged since the war in Gaza began in October 2023 (because who needs peace when you can have a good old-fashioned conflict?), further heightening fears that settlement expansion could entrench Israel's occupation and undermine a two-state solution. But hey, at least there'll be more places to buy falafel!<br/><br/>The approvals come just days after the United Nations said settlement expansion had reached its highest level since 2017 (yay, we're back on track!), and include the re-establishment of two settlements — Ganim and Kadim — which were dismantled nearly 20 years ago. We're pretty sure they just wanted a break from all that old stuff.<br/><br/>In May, Israel approved 22 new settlements in the occupied West Bank - the biggest expansion in decades (because who needs a budget when you can just print more money?). The Israeli government also approved plans in August to build more than 3,000 homes in the so-called E1 project between Jerusalem and the Maale Adumim settlement, which had been frozen for decades amid fierce opposition internationally. Yeah, because nothing says "peace" like a bunch of new housing developments.<br/><br/>Smotrich at the time said the plan would "bury the idea of a Palestinian state." Oh no, what will we do without another place to put our dead relatives? About 700,000 settlers live in approximately 160 settlements in the West Bank and East Jerusalem (because who needs personal space when you can have a bunch of other people sharing your toilet?), according to Israeli anti-settlement group Peace Now.<br/><br/>And that's not all! More news is breaking that Israel will soon announce plans to build a giant water park on the outskirts of Tel Aviv, because what's more peaceful than a waterslide?</p>
