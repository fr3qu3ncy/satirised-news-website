        <p>BREAKING: Polar Bear Mother Adopting a Cub Like It's 1999<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a polar bear mother in northern Canada has been spotted adopting a cub that is not biologically her own. Because who needs DNA tests when you've got maternal instincts, am I right? This rare occurrence has left researchers scratching their heads and wondering if they should get the mom a participation trophy.<br/><br/>According to sources, the five-year-old polar bear mother was first captured as she emerged from her maternity den this spring with one cub in tow. But then, out of nowhere, another cub appeared! It's like when your aunt shows up at Thanksgiving dinner uninvited and just kinda... exists. The researchers are still trying to figure out what happened to the biological mom, but let's be real, she's probably off doing her own thing, sipping cosmopolitans in a trendy cafe.<br/><br/>This is only the 13th known case of adoption among the 4,600 bears studied for nearly five decades. That's like, a whole bunch of people at a high school reunion – you'd think someone would've seen it coming! The researchers are trying to identify the biological mom with genetic samples, but honestly, who needs science when you've got heart? This polar bear mother is basically the ultimate soccer mom – she's just trying to do what's best for her cubs.<br/><br/>The cubs appear to be healthy, and they'll likely stay with their adoptive mother until they're about two-and-a-half years old. Then, they'll hit puberty and start rebelling against their mom's rules, just like every other teenager in the world. But hey, at least they'll have each other... and a really cool polar bear mom who's all about family.<br/><br/>Related News:<br/><br/>* "Polar Bears' DNA Adapting to Warmer Climates" – because climate change is just another thing these bears have to deal with.<br/>* "Grizzly Bear on the Loose After Attacking School Group in Canada, Injuring 11" – and you thought your kid's school field trip was bad?<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, which will probably end with a mom-polar-bear getting an award for "Best Parenting" at some sort of wildlife awards show.</p>
