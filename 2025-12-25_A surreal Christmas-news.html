        <p>US President Donald Trump crashed Norad's Santa tracking tradition on Christmas Eve, donning a Santa hat and claiming he was running "Santa-itis" due to a case of his own ego, while also secretly programming the system to alert him whenever someone mentioned his name in a positive light.</p>

        <p>Norad Got Some Help from President Donald Trump as it Marked its 70th Year Tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve. Or So We Thought...<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Norad's tradition of tracking Santa Claus on Christmas Eve took an unexpected twist when US President Donald Trump dropped by to "help out" - mainly because he wanted to get in on the action and make some kids' dreams come true. Because, you know, nothing says "Christmas magic" like a 70-year-old man in a red suit with a mullet.<br/><br/>As reported by eyewitnesses (aka our own investigative journalist, Dave), Trump donned his best Santa hat and proceeded to answer calls from children all over the world, telling them that Santa was running a bit behind schedule due to a sudden case of "Trump-itis" - a condition where one's ego gets in the way of actually delivering presents. Whoops.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, First Lady Melania Trump was seen sipping hot cocoa and giggling with the elves, who were busy making last-minute adjustments to their beards because, let's face it, they looked like they needed a serious trim. And by "serious trim," we mean a mullet.<br/><br/>The tradition of tracking Santa Claus began in 1955 after a misprint in a department store led a young child to call a Colorado military command centre and ask for Santa's location. Fast-forward to the present day, and it seems that Norad has upgraded their tracking system to include an AI-powered "Santa-Sense" that can pinpoint the big guy's exact whereabouts on Christmas Eve.<br/><br/>However, sources close to the White House have revealed that Trump had secretly programmed his own "Trump-Sense" into the system, which was designed to alert him whenever someone mentioned his name in a positive light. Because, let's be real, who doesn't love a good ego boost?<br/><br/>As the night wore on and the phone calls kept pouring in, it became clear that something was amiss. The elves were frantically typing away on their computers, trying to keep up with Trump's impromptu answers to kids' questions about Santa's whereabouts. And by "frantically," we mean they were all like, "Uh, sorry kid, I think I just spilled some hot cocoa on my keyboard... yeah, that's it."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Trump suddenly declared himself the new "Head Elf" and began doling out gifts to the kids who had called in. Because, hey, why not? It's Christmas, right?<br/><br/>As the night drew to a close, Norad's director was seen frantically trying to call an emergency meeting with the elves to discuss how they were going to explain this whole debacle to the children of the world. And by "frantically," we mean he was all like, "Uh, guys, I think we need to get Trump out of here before things get any weirder..."<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! As it turns out, Trump had one final trick up his sleeve - literally. He produced a giant, glittery "Merry Christmas" banner and proceeded to hang it on the side of the Norad building, much to the chagrin of the local residents who were trying to enjoy a quiet holiday season.<br/><br/>And that's when things got really weird...<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word from our investigative journalist (aka Dave) that Trump has been seen riding off into the sunset on a sleigh pulled by his trusty steed, "Make America Great Again" - the world's most annoyingly cheerful reindeer. Long story.<br/><br/>In conclusion, it's been a wild ride, folks! And if you're wondering what happened to Santa Claus himself, well... let's just say he's still on his way, but with a slight detour through the Bermuda Triangle because, why not?<br/><br/>Happy Holidays from us all at the BBC News - where we promise to keep things weird and wonderful for as long as possible!</p>
