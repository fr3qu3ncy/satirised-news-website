        <p>BREAKING: Ifunanya Nwangene, Nigerian Singer Who Sucked at "The Voice Nigeria", Dies After Getting Bitten by Cobra in Abuja<br/><br/>Lagos, Nigeria - In a shocking turn of events, Ifunanya Nwangene, the 26-year-old singer who was as much a threat to snakes as she was to singing competitions on "The Voice Nigeria", has met her untimely demise after being bitten by a cobra. The snake, allegedly named "Cobrakini" and described by witnesses as "looking rather pleased with itself", made off with the life of our dear Ifunanya.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the scene, Nwangene had been having a slumber party with her friends when Cobrakini decided to crash the bash. Her screams were heard echoing through the night air as she tried to fend off the snake, but alas, it was too late. The damage was done, and before anyone knew what hit them, Ifunanya was snatched away from this mortal coil.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that Nwangene's friends frantically searched for antivenom, only to discover that they had run out of "Singer-in-a-Box" – a special brand of medicine that supposedly made even the most tone-deaf singers sound like a million bucks. They then rushed her to a nearby hospital, where doctors managed to stabilize her condition, but alas, it was too late.<br/><br/>"I was trying to find the second bottle of 'Voice Whisperer', when I realized Ifunanya had... well, you know," said friend and former choir member Sam Ezugwu, visibly shaken. "We were all set for our next performance on 'The Voice Nigeria', and now she's gone. It's a dark day indeed."<br/><br/>As news of Nwangene's untimely passing spread like wildfire through the land, her fans took to social media to mourn the loss of their beloved singer.<br/><br/>"RIP Ifunanya," tweeted @Snaketracker3000. "May your voice forever be silenced by Cobrakini's deadly bite... just kidding, that snake was a menace."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, President Muhammadu Buhari has issued a statement expressing his deepest condolences to Nwangene's family and fans. He also announced plans to establish a special task force to tackle the scourge of cobras in Abuja.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The search for Cobrakini continues, with authorities offering a reward of 100 million naira (approximately $250,000 USD) for any information leading to its capture and punishment.</p>
