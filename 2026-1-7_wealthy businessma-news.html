        <p>BREAKING: Greenland for Sale! Sort of...<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump has been actively discussing purchasing the entire country of Greenland from Denmark. Because, you know, that's exactly how it works. You just walk into a store, point at a country on the shelf, and say "I'll take this one, please!"<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House (okay, we made those up), Trump is keenly interested in acquiring Greenland due to its rich mineral resources, including rare earth minerals that would make his hair look even more fabulous. And let's not forget about the strategic location of Greenland, which would give the US a perfect spot for early warning systems in case of an alien invasion (because, clearly, that's the real reason we're buying it).<br/><br/>Greenland, being a tiny island nation with a population smaller than a typical NBA team, is said to be worth a whopping $1 quadrillion. That's right, folks! A quadrillion dollars! We're not sure what they do with all that money in Greenland ( probably just hide it in their igloos and call it "igloo-ential savings"), but we're sure Trump has some grand plans for it.<br/><br/>Denmark, being the good neighbors that they are, have repeatedly stressed that Greenland is not for sale. But let's be real, who needs Denmark when you've got a guy like Trump on the phone saying "Hey, can I get Greenland with extra fries, please?"?<br/><br/>In related news, we hear that Melania has started decorating the White House with Greenland-themed decorations, including a giant model of the country made entirely out of cheese. Because why not, right?<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the Trump administration is considering renaming Greenland "Greenlandia" and making it the 51st state of the US. When asked about this development, Trump was overheard saying "It's gonna be huge, believe me. Just huge."<br/><br/>In conclusion, if you're looking for a new vacation spot or just want to invest in some rare earth minerals, Greenland is now officially on sale! Sort of...</p>
