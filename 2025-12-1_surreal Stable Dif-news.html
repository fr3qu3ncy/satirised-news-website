        <p>**BREAKING: US Envoy Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner to Meet Vladimir Putin, But Not Before They Stop for a Quick Game of Poker**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the United States has announced that special envoy Steve Witkoff and Donald Trump's son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner will be meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday. Sources close to the White House have confirmed that the meeting will take place over a game of high-stakes poker, with the winner being awarded control of the world's largest ball of twine.<br/><br/>According to insiders, Witkoff and Kushner are planning to arrive at the Kremlin in style, with Witkoff sporting a bright orange jumpsuit and Kushner rocking a pair of his signature cargo shorts. Putin, meanwhile, has been seen practicing his poker face in front of a mirror, muttering "nyet" under his breath.<br/><br/>The meeting is expected to be tense, as Witkoff and Kushner will be pushing for Russia to give up its demands for Ukrainian territory in exchange for a lucrative oil deal with Saudi Arabia. Putin, on the other hand, has been insisting that he wants to discuss the finer points of Russian roulette and the importance of proper bread-making techniques.<br/><br/>In related news, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has been seen practicing his "poker face" in front of a mirror, trying to perfect his "I'm not impressed by your silly demands, Comrade Putin" expression. Sources close to the Ukrainian president have confirmed that he will be attending a meeting with European leaders later today to discuss the finer points of Eurovision song contest strategy.<br/><br/>**Update:** In a shocking turn of events, it has been revealed that Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner have been secretly replaced by a pair of lookalike robots who are programmed to repeat the phrase "We're with you, Vlad" on an infinite loop. Putin, meanwhile, has been seen laughing maniacally as he shuffles his cards.<br/><br/>**Meanwhile:** In other news, a group of aliens from planet Zorgon have landed in Moscow and are currently trying to negotiate a trade deal with Putin. Sources close to the alien delegation have confirmed that they are willing to offer Putin a shipment of freshly harvested Gloopernuts in exchange for Russia's agreement to participate in an intergalactic game of bingo.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
