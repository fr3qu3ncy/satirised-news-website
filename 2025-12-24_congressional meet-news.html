        <p>BREAKING: Congresswoman Claims President's Name on Kennedy Center is "Illegally Awesome"<br/><br/>Washington D.C - In a shocking turn of events, US Representative Joyce Beatty has filed a lawsuit against the John F. Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts, claiming that renaming it after Donald Trump is "a travesty, a sham, and an affront to democracy... with extra cheese". The center's board voted last week to change its name to the Trump-Kennedy Center, citing President Trump's "yuge" contributions to the venue.<br/><br/>"I'm not just mad, I'm MAD AS A HATTER!" Beatty exclaimed in her lawsuit. "I called into the meeting to voice my opposition, but they muted me, like trying to silence a Kardashian at a family dinner. It was like trying to stop a Trump tweetstorm – impossible!"<br/><br/>Beatty claims that renaming the center requires an "act of Congress", which she believes is a ridiculous and arbitrary requirement, much like requiring Beyoncé's hair to be perfectly styled for every public appearance.<br/><br/>"It's like they're saying, 'Hey, we can rename this iconic landmark after Donald Trump because he's got a great comb-over'!" Beatty fumed. "I mean, seriously, who needs an act of Congress when you've got Trump's Twitter account?"<br/><br/>The White House responded to the lawsuit by releasing a statement that said President Trump had "stepped up" and saved the Kennedy Center from financial ruin, much like Superman saves Lois Lane from certain doom.<br/><br/>"President Trump's leadership skills are unmatched," said a spokesperson. "He's like a ninja – swift, stealthy, and always ready to pounce on a unsuspecting landmark."<br/><br/>The renaming of the center has been met with widespread criticism, with many calling it an attempt by Trump to further his own ego and cement his place in history as a "self-proclaimed Emperor-for-Life".<br/><br/>"This is just another example of Trump's narcissistic tendencies," said a former Kennedy family member. "I mean, who needs a living memorial when you can have a Trump-Kennedy Center, am I right?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, construction workers outside the center were seen installing new signs that read "The Donald J. Trump and The John F. Kennedy Memorial Center for the Performing Arts" in bold, golden letters.<br/><br/>"It's like they're trying to blind people with their sheer audacity," said one worker. "But hey, at least it's a great Instagram opportunity – just imagine the likes and follows we'll get!"<br/><br/>As the controversy continues to simmer, one thing is clear: this is not over until Trump tweets about it again.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
