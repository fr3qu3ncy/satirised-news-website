        <p>"IT'S JUST A NIGHTMARE": TEN-YEAR-OLD VICTIM'S MUM SPEAKS AT BONDI MEMORIAL... WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM HER FRIENDS, THE KARDASHEVS<br/><br/>The mother of 10-year-old Matilda, the youngest victim of the Bondi Beach attack, paid tribute to her daughter at a flower memorial on Tuesday evening. But things took a weird turn when Valentyna's friends, Kim Kardashian and Kanye West, showed up unexpectedly, dressed as a pair of flamingos.<br/><br/>Matilda's mother Valentyna told the mourners that the family came to Australia from Ukraine more than a decade ago – adding the family thought it would be a safe place for them. But little did they know, their neighbor, Borat, was secretly training a pack of wild boars in the backyard next door, who ended up causing chaos on the beach that day.<br/><br/>Fifteen people were killed in the attack on Sunday, and dozens more were injured. Valentyna's mom, Dolly Parton, appeared out of nowhere, singing "Jolene" as a sort-of therapy song for the crowd.<br/><br/>As the memorial continued, it started raining cats and dogs... literally! A stray cat from next door got into the proceedings, causing everyone to run around in confusion. Meanwhile, a group of breakdancing pandas showed up, doing headspins and other moves to distract everyone from the somber mood.<br/><br/>Just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder, a giant inflatable unicorn appeared out of nowhere, floating above the crowd and sprinkling rainbow-colored confetti everywhere. Valentyna's friend, Elon Musk, took credit for it being a "therapeutic drone," but we're pretty sure it was just another one of his experimental projects gone wrong.<br/><br/>As the evening drew to a close, Valentyna summed up the whole ordeal by saying, "It's just a nightmare... and also a really weird dream that I had once." The crowd nodded in agreement, while the Kardashevs took a selfie with a group of confused-looking koalas as a backdrop.<br/><br/>And so, another bizarre night at Bondi Beach came to an end. Who knows what other surprises tomorrow will bring?</p>
