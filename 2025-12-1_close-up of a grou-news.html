    <div class="article">
        <p>**BREAKING: Anti-government demonstrators likely targeted with camite, our investigation finds... but only if you're a hipster**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, it appears that anti-government protesters in Georgia were sprayed with the world's most exclusive and rare chemical weapon - camite. Yes, you read that right, camite! The same stuff that was used to terrorize Germany during World War One.<br/><br/>Now, we know what you're thinking... "Camite? Hasn't that been replaced by CS gas since the 30s?" And to that, we say... "No way, José!" According to our investigation (which involved consulting with a bunch of random people on the internet), camite is back in business and being used by rogue government agencies to oppress hipsters like you.<br/><br/>**Camite: The ultimate party crasher**<br/><br/>So, what exactly is camite? Well, it's a toxic compound that's like the Instagram filters of chemical weapons - it makes everything look worse. Our sources (okay, we asked Gela Khasaia from Tbilisi) say that when protesters were sprayed with camite, they felt their skin burning for days. Like, imagine being forced to watch an endless loop of cat videos on repeat... that's what it was like.<br/><br/>**The Ministry of Truth tries to cover up**<br/><br/>When confronted with our findings, the Georgian government responded by saying that our investigation is "absurd" and that the police had acted legally in response to the "illegal actions of brutal criminals." Okay, sure... and I'm the King of England. But let's be real, guys - we all know who's really in charge here.<br/><br/>**Camite: The new normal?**<br/><br/>In related news, camite is now available at your local Home Depot for a limited time only. Just kidding (or am I?). Seriously though, if you're planning on protesting anything in the near future, make sure to bring a spare set of lungs and some really strong deodorant.<br/><br/>**And in other news...**<br/><br/>The US government has announced that they will be deploying camite to deal with the ongoing protests in Washington D.C. Overheard in the hallways of Congress: "Dude, we're gonna need more CS gas."</p>
