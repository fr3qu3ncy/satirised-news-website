        <p>BREAKING: Coast Guard Seizes Oil Tanker in Caribbean Sea, But Things Get Weird<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the US Coast Guard boarded two "ghost fleet" tanker ships in a "meticulously coordinated" operation, according to Homeland Security Secretary Kristi Noem. But what's even more surprising is that the operation involved a surprise appearance by Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson, who was seen doing backflips on the deck of one of the tankers.<br/><br/>The two tankers, the Marinera and the Sophia, were said to be carrying oil from Venezuela - but not just any oil. No, this was special oil, infused with the essence of Justin Bieber's hair gel. It turns out that the oil was being transported to a secret underground bunker where it would be used to fuel the world's largest collection of lava lamps.<br/><br/>The operation took place within hours of each other, with one ship in the North Atlantic Sea and the other in international waters near the Caribbean. Witnesses reported seeing a group of mariachi players performing a lively rendition of "La Cucaracha" on the deck of one of the tankers, while another group was busy setting up a mini-golf course.<br/><br/>Noem said that the tankers were "either last docked in Venezuela or en route to it," but what she didn't mention was that they were also carrying a cargo hold full of disco balls and platform shoes. It's rumored that the oil was being used to fuel a massive underwater rave party, where the world's top DJs would spin tracks until the oil ran out.<br/><br/>When asked for comment, The Rock simply shrugged and said, "Can you smell what the Coast Guard is cooking?" before bursting into a rendition of "I Will Survive."<br/><br/>In related news, the US Navy has announced that it will be launching a new fleet of submarines powered by the same special oil. The subs will be equipped with state-of-the-art disco balls and a built-in karaoke system, making them the most fun you'll ever have on a submarine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuela has denied any involvement in the operation, but sources close to the government say that they're actually planning a counter-attack involving a fleet of giant rubber chickens.</p>
