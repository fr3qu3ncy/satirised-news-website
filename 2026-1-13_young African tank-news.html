        <p>BREAKING: Jihadists Bring a Nation to Its Knees with Fuel Blockade, Niger Revokes Licences of Tanker Drivers Who Refuse to Deliver<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the tiny West African nation of Niger has taken drastic measures against its own tanker drivers who refuse to deliver fuel to neighbouring Mali. The reason? A group of jihadis (that's what we'll call them from now on) have imposed a fuel blockade on Mali, and things are getting real.<br/><br/>It all started when an al-Qaeda affiliate (yes, those guys again) decided to flex their muscles by attacking petrol tankers on major highways in Mali. The landlocked country is dependent on fuel imports, and Niger was kind enough to agree to supply 85 million litres of fuel over six months to its vast, northern desert region, where various militant groups operate. But little did they know, the jihadis had other plans.<br/><br/>The fuel convoys from Niger making the journey across a route of 1,400km (870 miles) have faced jihadist attacks even under military escort. It's like trying to deliver pizza to a rave party – you just can't get through! Last November, Niger delivered 82 fuel tankers to Mali, which managed to stabilise the energy supply hit by the recent blockade. But plans were disrupted after drivers and transport operators refused to make the deliveries. Talk about a bad day at the office!<br/><br/>This has prompted Niger's transport ministry to revoke the licences of 14 transport operators and 19 drivers for refusing to transport the fuel. Yep, you read that right – they're basically telling them: "Hey, guys, get back to work or lose your licence!" Another operator was handed a one-year suspension, which is like being sent to time-out for not doing their chores.<br/><br/>But here's the thing – the militant group Jama'at Nusrat al-Islam wal-Muslimin (JNIM) that imposed the blockade has kidnapped drivers and torched lorries. Last year, schools and universities across Mali were temporarily closed because of the severe fuel scarcity. It's like someone put a big ol' spanner in the works, and now everyone's just trying to get by.<br/><br/>The US last November urged Americans not to travel to Mali (because, you know, safety first), and France advised its citizens in the West African country to leave (basically saying, "Hey, get outta there, it's not safe!"). Mali's military government is led by Gen Assimi Goïta, who promised to deal with the long-running security crisis prompted by a separatist rebellion in the north. Yeah, good luck with that!<br/><br/>"I THOUGHT I WOULD DIE" – FREED CAPTIVE TELLS BBC OF LIFE IN WEST AFRICAN JIHADIST BASE<br/><br/>We're not even kidding when we say this is getting real. The situation is dire, and Niger's transport ministry has taken drastic measures to address it. Will the tanker drivers learn their lesson? Only time will tell.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>The communications authority in Uganda has imposed an internet blackout ahead of Thursday's election (because, you know, misinformation can't be allowed). Operation Against Nigerian Kidnapping Gang Kills '200 Bandits' – Official Tells BBC. And guess what? The bandits have recently become more active in the central state of Kogi. You get the picture.<br/><br/>It's a wild world out there, folks! Stay vigilant and keep your wits about you.</p>
