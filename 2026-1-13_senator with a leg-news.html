        <p>BREAKING: Senator Mark Kelly Sues Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth for Trying to Demote Him Because He's Just Too Darn Good at Filming Videos<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US Senator Mark Kelly has filed a lawsuit against Defence Secretary Pete Hegseth, claiming that the Pentagon is trying to demote him because he's just too darn good at making videos.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the matter (okay, it was his wife Gabrielle Giffords who told us), Kelly had filmed a video telling military personnel that they could refuse unlawful orders. Trump saw the video and freaked out, calling Kelly "seditionist" on Truth Social (which is just a fancy way of saying "Twitter with more lies"). Hegseth then tried to open up proceedings to lower Kelly's retirement grade, which would have resulted in a reduction in his pay.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! As part of the lawsuit, Kelly is demanding that Hegseth be forced to watch an endless loop of cat videos as punishment for trying to demote him. "It's just not fair," said Kelly in a statement. "I'm a highly decorated Navy captain and astronaut, and I should be able to film whatever videos I want without being harassed by the government."<br/><br/>Hegseth, on the other hand, claims that Kelly is just trying to get attention because he's bored with his job as a senator. "He's always filming something," said Hegseth in an interview. "I'm starting to think he's secretly a YouTube star or something."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has weighed in on the situation, tweeting out a series of confusing and unrelated statements about his favorite foods (pizza, hamburgers, and taco salad). When asked for comment, Trump's spokesperson said that the president was "too busy eating lunch" to talk about the lawsuit.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The BBC has just received word that Bill Clinton is being held in contempt by Republicans for skipping a committee hearing on Jeffrey Epstein. When asked what this had to do with Kelly vs Hegseth, our correspondent replied, "Um, nothing? But wouldn't it be funny if Bill Clinton showed up at the hearing and started filming a video about how he loves mullets?"<br/><br/>MULLET UPDATE: In other news, the mullet contest being held in Pennsylvania has been cancelled because all the contestants decided to grow their hair out instead. When asked why they made this decision, one contestant replied, "We just couldn't compete with Mark Kelly's legendary mullet."<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre unrelated story, a bearded man was seen standing in front of a pile of snow, shouting at an apartment building while wearing a grey beanie and jacket. When asked what he was doing, the man said, "I'm just trying to get some fresh air before I have to go back to my desk job."</p>
