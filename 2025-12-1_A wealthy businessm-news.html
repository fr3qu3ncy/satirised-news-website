        <p>**BREAKING: Trump Releases Fraudster Executive Days into Prison Sentence, Cites Concerns from Gentile that Prosecutors Had Elicited False Testimony**<br/><br/>In a shocking move, US President Donald Trump has commuted the sentence of former investment manager David Gentile, who was just days into a seven-year prison sentence for fraud. But what's really shocking is that Trump's decision was influenced by concerns from Gentile himself - not about his crimes, but about how prosecutors had "elicited false testimony" against him.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, Gentile had been complaining to Trump that the Department of Justice under former President Joe Biden had made multiple missteps in their investigation. Specifically, he claimed that prosecutors had coached witnesses and manipulated evidence to get the desired outcome.<br/><br/>"I mean, who doesn't love a good game of 'he said, she said'?" Trump said in a statement. "I'm all about fairness and justice, which is why I commuted David's sentence. Besides, I've got my own testimony - it's always 100% true and totally not fabricated at all."<br/><br/>Gentile's lawyer, Alina Habba (who was also recently disqualified as US Attorney for New Jersey), praised Trump's decision, saying "it's about time someone stood up to the Department of Justice's 'witch hunt' tactics. We're thrilled that David is now a free man, and we look forward to his next investment opportunity - perhaps a timeshare in Dubai?"<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the White House is facing backlash for its handling of the situation. Critics are accusing Trump of using his executive powers to help out a wealthy donor, rather than upholding the law.<br/><br/>"Let's be real," said a spokesperson for the Democratic Party. "This is just another example of Trump's crony capitalism at work. If Gentile had been some ordinary Joe, he'd still be serving his sentence in prison - but because he's a friend of the President's, suddenly everything is okay."<br/><br/>In related news, the US Navy has announced that it will be issuing new guidelines for its personnel regarding "proper etiquette" when interacting with foreign dignitaries. The move comes after a recent incident in which Trump was spotted sharing a plate of nachos with Vladimir Putin.<br/><br/>"We take these matters very seriously," said a spokesperson for the Navy. "From now on, our sailors will be trained to politely decline any offers of food from Russian leaders - especially if those food items are served with mayonnaise."<br/><br/>And finally, in a bizarre twist, it's been reported that David Gentile has already begun seeking funding for his next big business venture: a line of edible cutlery made from recycled tortilla chips. When asked about the plan, Trump said "it's going to be huge, folks - just huge."</p>
