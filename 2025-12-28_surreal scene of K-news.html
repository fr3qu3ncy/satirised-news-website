        <p>BREAKING: Thousands of homes in Finland, Sweden, and Norway left without power... and a guy from the Muppets is stuck in Sweden<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Kermit the Frog has been spotted wandering the streets of Stockholm, Sweden, searching for a decent cup of coffee. The beloved Muppet character was visiting his friends Gonzo and Fozzie Bear when Storm Johannes swept through the region, knocking out power to tens of thousands of homes.<br/><br/>"I'm not sure what's more surprising," said Kermit in an interview with BBC News, "the fact that I got stuck here without a latte or that there are actually people who think it's a good idea to wear funny hats and sing songs on national television."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, back in Finland, the storm known as Hannes left over 60,000 homes without power. Residents were seen using candles and flashlights to light their way, while others tried to charge their phones by running down the street while flapping their arms like chicken wings.<br/><br/>In Norway's Nordland region, a group of reindeer were spotted sipping hot cocoa in front of a warm fire, while a lone Norwegian chef was seen cooking up a storm on his grill. "We Norwegians are made of hardier stuff," said the chef with a wink. "A little wind and rain won't stop us from making a good meal!"<br/><br/>But it wasn't all fun and games in Sweden. A man in his 50s died after being struck by a tree at the Kungsberget ski resort, while another man in his 60s was taken to hospital after being hit by a tree while working in a forest in Hofors.<br/><br/>"We're still investigating the cause of these incidents," said a Swedish official, "but we think it might have something to do with the guy from The Muppet Show who's running around the country, causing chaos and mayhem wherever he goes."<br/><br/>UPDATE: Kermit has been spotted trying to hitch a ride on a Swedish bus, but the driver just laughed at him and told him to get his own coffee.<br/><br/>related stories:<br/><br/>* "Muppets Invade Stockholm: A Report from the Front Lines"<br/>* "Finnish Reindeer Start Hot Cocoa Trend"<br/>* "Norwegian Chef Cooks Up Storm with BBQ Sauce"<br/><br/>[Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story, and don't forget to follow us on social media for the latest in Muppet news!](https://www.bbc.com/news/live)</p>
