        <p>BREAKING: Dr Dirk Brandherm and his colleagues have identified more than 600 suspected house platforms in the Brusselstown Ring, but things just got weird<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, researchers at Queen's University Belfast have uncovered a sprawling hilltop settlement that's making everyone question their understanding of prehistoric Ireland. But wait, it gets even better! Dr Dirk Brandherm and his colleagues (who are basically the MacGyvers of archaeology) have discovered over 600 suspected houses in the Brusselstown Ring, which is like, a really big hill with a wall around it.<br/><br/>Now, you might be thinking, "What's so special about that?" Well, my friends, this settlement is significant because it challenges the widely-held theory that the Vikings built the first towns in Ireland. That's right, folks, the Vikings - those notorious party animals from Scandinavia (just kidding, they were actually pretty serious and brutal). But seriously, Dr Brandherm says that with more than 600 roundhouses concentrated in one spot, we're talking about a proto-town of sorts, which is like 2,000 years before the Vikings showed up.<br/><br/>But here's where things get really crazy<br/><br/>During their excavation process (which involved three people digging in a hole while wearing a range of clothing), researchers discovered a stone-lined chamber that was apparently fed by a stream from an outcrop uphill. Now, this might sound like something out of a fantasy novel, but trust me, it gets better! Dr Brandherm described the cistern as "boat-shaped" and "slightly larger than a roundhouse". If confirmed (and I'm sure it will be), this would be a first in Ireland - which is just a fancy way of saying that nobody knew about it until now.<br/><br/>And if you thought that was weird, wait until you hear about the excavation process<br/><br/>Four test excavations were completed by archaeologists to understand the site's occupation. Yes, four! It's like they were trying to break some kind of record for most unnecessary excavations ever conducted. But hey, at least they had fun doing it - or so I'm told.<br/><br/>The Bottom Line: Dr Dirk Brandherm and his colleagues have identified more than 600 suspected house platforms in the Brusselstown Ring<br/><br/>Which is like...well, you get the idea. It's a big deal, folks! And who knows what other secrets this ancient settlement might hold? Maybe there's a hidden treasure or two waiting to be uncovered (just kidding, it's probably just some old pottery and broken dreams). But seriously, if you're ever in Ireland and you see a hill with a wall around it, just remember: Dr Dirk Brandherm was there before you.</p>
