        <p>BREAKING: Chaos Erupts in Bangladesh as Protests Over Youth Leader's Death Get Out of Hand<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the offices of two prominent Bangladeshi newspapers were set ablaze by protesters, leaving staff "gasping for air" like a bunch of scuba divers who forgot their oxygen tanks. The protests, sparked by the death of Sharif Osman Hadi, a key figure in last year's anti-government movement that ousted ex-PM Sheikh Hasina, took a bizarre turn when protesters started throwing pizzas at each other and singing "I Will Survive" on repeat.<br/><br/>As the demonstrations escalated, former PM Hasina herself appeared on the scene, wearing a pair of oversized novelty sunglasses and a fedora, shouting "Don't stop believin' in me, baby!" while waving a giant inflatable chicken. Witnesses described the scene as " absolute pandemonium, with people running around like headless chickens, except they were all wearing chicken costumes."<br/><br/>The Daily Star's consulting editor, Kamal Ahmed, was seen sipping tea and muttering to himself about the impending doom of independent journalism in Bangladesh, while Prothom Alo's staff were too busy arguing over who ate the last of their office snacks to notice the flames engulfing their building.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, a group of protesters claimed they were protesting against the "authoritarian" government for not serving them enough biryani at the protests. When asked what prompted this sudden outburst of gastronomic outrage, one protester quipped, "We just wanted some decent food, you know? And a few more selfies with Sharif Osman Hadi's Facebook page as the backdrop."<br/><br/>As the situation continued to spiral out of control, former PM Hasina was seen being escorted away by security forces while whispering something in the ear of a bemused-looking David Hasselhoff. When asked what she said to him, Hasini replied, "Just told him to get his Baywatch swimsuit ready for next year's election campaign."<br/><br/>In other news, Bangladesh's interim government has condemned the violence and vowed to hand perpetrators "full justice," which roughly translates to "we'll give them a stern talking-to and maybe a slap on the wrist if they behave themselves."<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from this unfolding catastrophe, folks!</p>
