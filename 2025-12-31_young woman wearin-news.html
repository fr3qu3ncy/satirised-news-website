        <p>BREAKING: Thailand Releases 18 Cambodian Soldiers, Because Who Needs a Ceasefire When You Have Justin Bieber Concert Tickets?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Thailand has released 18 Cambodian soldiers held captive since July, not because they were tired of holding them hostage, but because they finally got around to renewing their Netflix subscriptions and binge-watching the entire season of "Stranger Things." Sources close to the Thai government confirm that the release was prompted by a heated discussion about who was the better hero, Eleven or Sherlock Holmes. The Cambodian soldiers, on the other hand, were thrilled to be free again and immediately began planning their next big adventure – a trip to Disneyland.<br/><br/>New Ceasefire Deal Unfolds: Because Who Needs Borders When You Have TikTok?<br/><br/>As part of the new ceasefire deal, both countries agreed to freeze the front lines where they are now (because who needs borders when you have Instagram?), ban reinforcements (but not TikTok videos), and allow civilians living in border areas to return as soon as possible – provided they bring their own Wi-Fi. The 72-hour deadline for releasing the 18 Cambodian soldiers was delayed due to a misunderstanding about the meaning of "noon local time" versus "Thai time," which is apparently 30 minutes behind regular time.<br/><br/>Chinese Diplomatic Pressure: Because Who Needs Human Rights When You Have Kung Pao Chicken?<br/><br/>The ceasefire deal was brokered by China, who insisted that both countries put aside their differences and focus on more important things – like the best way to cook noodles. Despite Thailand's complaints about Cambodia violating the truce by flying unmanned aerial vehicles into Thai airspace, the Chinese government successfully pressured them into releasing the soldiers. "We're just happy to have everyone get along," said a spokesperson for the Chinese embassy, while simultaneously eating a plate of Kung Pao chicken.<br/><br/>Cambodian Soldiers Return Home: Because Who Needs Military Training When You Have Yoga?<br/><br/>The 18 Cambodian soldiers returned home to a hero's welcome, complete with red roses and a yoga class to help them relax after their ordeal. Their families were overjoyed to see them again and immediately began planning a family reunion – featuring a massive game of "Among Us" and a cook-off to see who could make the best stir-fry.<br/><br/>In Other News: Because Who Needs World Peace When You Have Justin Bieber Concert Tickets?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in other news, Thailand has announced plans to host a Justin Bieber concert, which promises to bring world peace (just kidding, it's just going to be a bunch of screaming teenagers). The Cambodian government has also launched an investigation into the best way to make khao soi, the national dish. And in a shocking turn of events, the Thai military has announced plans to replace their uniforms with spandex onesies – because who needs dignity when you can have flexibility?</p>
