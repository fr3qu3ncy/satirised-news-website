        <p>SIX INJURED AS HOUSE EXPLODES IN CALIFORNIA, CHAOS ERUPTS<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a house in Hayward, California exploded yesterday, leaving six people injured and several nearby properties damaged. But that's not the most surprising part – what really happened here is that it all started because of a natural gas line leak.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, firefighters were called to the scene earlier in the day to investigate a possible gas leak. They examined the area, made some notes, and then went back to their trucks for a nice cup of coffee. Little did they know, their break was short-lived. Just hours later, BOOM! The house exploded.<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a Hollywood movie," said one witness, who wished to remain anonymous because he's still traumatized from the whole ordeal. "I mean, I've seen some crazy things in my time, but this takes the cake."<br/><br/>The blast was so powerful that it shattered windows and damaged nearby buildings. In fact, at least three buildings on two properties were "significantly damaged," according to the Alameda County Fire Department.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets even better! As emergency responders rushed to the scene, they discovered that one of the injured people was none other than Justin Bieber's cousin – yes, you read that right. It turns out that JB's cousin was in the neighborhood visiting his aunt and uncle (the owners of the exploded house) when the blast occurred.<br/><br/>"I'm just glad everyone is okay," said a representative from the Bieb's camp. "But let me tell you, we're still trying to figure out how our cousin ended up at that address. It's like he has a sixth sense for getting into weird situations."<br/><br/>And speaking of weird situations, it was later revealed that the explosion was caused by a faulty natural gas line – which just so happens to be owned by the same company that supplies fuel to the Mars Curiosity Rover.<br/><br/>When asked about the coincidence, a spokesperson for the company said, "Uh, well... we're looking into it. Yeah."<br/><br/>As for the people injured in the blast, they're all expected to make a full recovery – except for one guy who got his toupee blown off. He's still recovering from that emotional trauma.<br/><br/>In related news, Kanye West has announced plans to write a song about the explosion, titled "Explosion of Chaos." When asked what inspired him to tackle this topic, Yeezy said, "Dude, I just felt the energy of that blast and knew I had to capture it in music. It's gonna be huge, trust me."<br/><br/>And so, as we reflect on the chaos that unfolded in Hayward, California, one thing is clear: sometimes the universe just likes to shake things up.</p>
