        <p>"Trump Withdraws US from Dozens of International Orgs, Including One That's Still Got His Accountants on Speed Dial"<br/><br/>In a shocking move that has left the world wondering if he's finally lost his mind (again), President Trump announced yesterday that the United States will be withdrawing from dozens of international organizations, including some that have helped him win numerous "Man of the Year" awards for Most Creative Use of Excel Spreadsheets.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the White House, the decision was made because these entities "no longer serve American interests," which is code for "we can't get a good Wi-Fi signal at any of their meetings." The memo also stated that many of these organizations promote "radical climate policies" and "global governance" - or in other words, anything that gets in the way of Trump's favorite game, "Guess Who'll Fund My Next Golf Course."<br/><br/>Among the groups being axed are the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (which has a snazzy acronym but still can't get its act together to save us from global warming), the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (which is just a bunch of geeks in lab coats trying to tell us what's what, anyway), and the International Solar Alliance (which sounds suspiciously like a plot to steal the world's solar panels).<br/><br/>"We're outta here," said Trump, flanked by his trusty sidekick, Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson. "We've got better things to do than waste our taxpayer dollars on these 'globalist' organizations that just want to take our lunch money."<br/><br/>When asked about the implications of this move, Dr. Seuss himself was unavailable for comment (he's been too busy writing new rhymes about climate change and Trump's hair), but sources close to his estate say he's working on a new book titled "The Sneetches: A Cautionary Tale About Trump's Foreign Policy."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, European leaders have condemned the move as "utterly, completely, and totally bonkers." The UN Secretary-General has called for an emergency meeting of world leaders to discuss how to handle this crisis - or in other words, how to get Trump to put his phone on silent mode during meetings.<br/><br/>As one wag noted, it's a wonder the US didn't also withdraw from the Olympics (after all, who needs international cooperation when you've got a Gold Medal-worthy hairpiece?). But then again, that would have meant missing out on the chance to host the next Summer Games in Trump-branded merchandise - now, that's what we call "winning."<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* "Trump Withdraws US from Climate Change Treaty; Cries 'Fake News' When Told It Was Already Happening"<br/>* "Experts Predict Global Chaos as Trump Declares Independence from International Orgs; Suggest We All Just Get Along and Share Our Lunch Money Instead"<br/>* "Trump's Foreign Policy: A Timeline of Awkward Moments, Sad!
