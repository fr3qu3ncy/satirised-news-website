        <p>BREAKING: Zambian-American Influencer "One Boss Lady" Gets 18 Months for Hate Speech<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ethel Chisono Edwards, known to her millions of followers as "One Boss Lady", has been sentenced to 18 months in prison for hate speech. The Zambian-American influencer and estate agent from New York was found guilty of making insulting remarks about Zambia's President Hakainde Hichilema.<br/><br/>But here's the twist - Edwards was caught using a computer system (aka her iPhone) to publish the offending statements while sipping margaritas by the pool with her BFF, Pamela Anderson. Who knew that cybercrime could be so... splashy?<br/><br/>As she pleaded guilty in a Lusaka magistrate's court, Edwards apologized for her words, saying "I want to unreservedly apologize to the president, Mr Hakainde Hichilema, his family, and the nation of Zambia for the words that I uttered against the president and for the negative effects that those words may have caused to the president, his family, and the nation at large... Oh, and also for using up all the pool towels."<br/><br/>Her lawyer, Joseph Katati, argued that Edwards was a remorseful first offender with potential, adding that she sponsored a Zambian girls' football team that would suffer from her imprisonment. "She's like a digital Kardashian - but without the Instagram following," he said.<br/><br/>Magistrate Webster Milumbe delivered the verdict, stating that hate speech had become increasingly common and that Edwards's sentence would be effective from the time of her arrest... which just so happened to coincide with the start of the Zambian football league.<br/><br/>The jailing of Edwards has divided opinion in Zambia, with some saying it was necessary while others argued that it violates freedom of speech. President Hichilema himself tweeted "Just another example of how cybercrime can ruin a good tan... and a girls' football team's chance at the championship"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!<br/><br/>[Image description: A picture of Ethel Chisono Edwards, aka "One Boss Lady", wearing sunglasses next to a pool with trees in the background. She looks every inch the digital influencer - until you notice she's actually trying to hide from her lawyer.]<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that Edwards has been spotted in the prison yard, using her phone to live-stream her experiences and gain even more followers... Go figure!</p>
