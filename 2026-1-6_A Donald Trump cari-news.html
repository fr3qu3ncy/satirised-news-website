        <p>GREENLAND IN TURMOIL: TRUMP'S OUTRAGEOUS THREAT TO ANNEX ISLAND SPARKS REACTION<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Donald Trump has refused to rule out using force to annex Greenland - sending shockwaves across the globe. The US President's brazen threat has sparked a firestorm of controversy, with Denmark's Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen warning that an attack by the US would spell the end of Nato.<br/><br/>But what does this mean for the rest of us? Well, let's just say it's not great news for the Inuit who call Greenland home. Morgan Angaju, a 27-year-old Inuit resident, told BBC Newsbeat that Trump's policies have been "terrifying" and that he's worried about being invaded by the US military.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump's senior aide Stephen Miller seemed to confirm that the US is indeed planning on invading Greenland, saying it would be "the formal position of the US government that Greenland should be part of the US." When asked if they'd rule out using force to annex the island, Miller simply shrugged and said "nobody's going to fight the US over the future of Greenland."<br/><br/>The international community is not taking this threat lying down. Six European allies - the UK, France, Germany, Italy, Poland, Spain, and Denmark - have rallied together to support their fellow Nato member, releasing a joint statement that says Greenland belongs to its people, and only Denmark and Greenland can decide on matters concerning their relations.<br/><br/>But Trump's not backing down, folks. He's still insisting that the US needs Greenland for national security reasons, despite the fact that it's already got a population of 57,000 people who don't want to be part of the United States. In other words, this is just another example of Trump's ego getting in the way of good sense and diplomacy.<br/><br/>So, what can we expect next? Well, it looks like we'll soon be seeing a rerun of that famous US military raid on Venezuela, where Trump's elite troops went in to seize President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face drugs and weapons charges in New York. Who knows, maybe they'll even get to experience the thrill of ice-skating on Greenland's frozen tundra while they're at it.<br/><br/>The fate of Greenland remains uncertain, but one thing is clear: this whole situation is a total disaster waiting to happen. So, what do you think? Should Trump be allowed to invade Greenland without consequence? Let us know in the comments below!<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just as we were going to press, we received word that Morgan Angaju's cat, Mr Whiskers, has been spotted lounging on a Greenlandic iceberg, looking smug and self-satisfied. When asked for comment, Mr Whiskers simply shrugged and said "I'm just here for the fish."</p>
