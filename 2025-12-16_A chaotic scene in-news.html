        <p>THE BONKERS BBC<br/><br/>BREAKING: US STRIKES ALLEGED DRUG BOATS IN PACIFIC, BUT IT'S ALL JUST A DISTRACTION FROM DONALD TRUMP'S REAL PROBLEM - HIS HAIR<br/><br/>The US military has carried out more than 20 strikes in international waters on alleged drug vessels since September. But let's be real, folks, this is just a smokescreen to distract us from the real issue: Donald Trump's hair.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (i.e., my neighbor's cat), these alleged drug boats were actually just a bunch of Mexican fishermen trying to make a living in the Pacific. But who needs facts when you have a good old-fashioned US military strike, am I right?<br/><br/>The US Southern Command posted footage of the strikes on social media, but all anyone can see is a bunch of confused-looking dolphins trying to figure out what's going on. It's like they're saying, "Uh, excuse me, humans? Can someone please explain why you just blew up our tacos?"<br/><br/>BREAKING: HILLARY CLINTON NOW LEADING CHARGE AGAINST ALLEGED DRUG BOATS<br/><br/>Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has emerged from retirement to lead the charge against these alleged drug boats. When asked about her new role, she simply said, "Well, someone's gotta do it. And by 'it,' I mean take down Donald Trump's hair."<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Vice President Mike Pence has been spotted wearing a bright pink wig and attempting to infiltrate the US military's communications network. When questioned about his new look, he simply said, "I'm just trying to blend in with my fellow Americans... who are secretly all balding men in their 60s."<br/><br/>BREAKING: NEW VIDEO SHOWS DONALD TRUMP'S HAIR ACTUALLY A REAL-LIFE DRAGON<br/><br/>A shocking video has emerged showing Donald Trump's hair as a real-life dragon, wreaking havoc on the White House. When asked about the footage, Trump simply said, "Fake news! That's just my trusty sidekick, 'Hair-nardo' trying to distract from my tremendous success."<br/><br/>And that's the latest from the Bonkers BBC. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story... or not.</p>
