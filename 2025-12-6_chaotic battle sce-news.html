        <p>BREAKING: Pakistan and Afghanistan's Taliban Engage in Border Brawl Over Who Gets to Keep Theirs<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Pakistani forces and Afghanistan's Taliban government have clashed along their 1,600-mile border, with each side accusing the other of breaking a fragile ceasefire. And by "fragile," we mean completely not-working-at-all.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report that residents in the Afghan city of Spin Boldak fled for their lives as the two sides exchanged fire for four hours straight. "I was sipping chai and watching cat videos when suddenly, KABOOM! I thought it was just another episode of 'Keeping Up with the Kardashians,' but nope, it was gunfire!" said one resident.<br/><br/>The fighting broke out despite a ceasefire brokered by Qatar and Turkey in October – a fragile truce that's been as effective as a teenager's promise to do chores. "We're shocked," said a Pakistani government spokesperson, adding, "Shocked and appalled by the lack of effort put into maintaining this peace agreement."<br/><br/>On the other side, Taliban officials claimed Pakistan had initiated the attacks, citing "unprovoked firing" – which is code for "we got bored and started shooting." A Taliban spokesperson added, "We're not sure what they were thinking, but we guess it's back to 'shoot first, ask questions later' for us."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, the fighting took place near a group of Pokémon trainers who had set up camp in the area. "I was trying to catch that pesky Charmander when suddenly, artillery shells started flying everywhere!" said one trainer. "Now my team is all traumatized and refuse to play with me anymore."<br/><br/>As tensions rise, both sides have vowed to take a tougher stance – which roughly translates to "we'll just keep on shooting until someone wins." Pakistan has accused the Taliban of giving shelter to armed groups that attack their territory, while the Taliban has shot back (pun intended) by saying Pakistan is blaming them for its own security failures.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, residents in nearby Kandahar are advised to stay indoors and enjoy a nice cup of tea – or better yet, watch some cat videos. After all, when life gives you lemons, make lemonade. But when life gives you gunfire, just grab your favorite snack, sit back, and enjoy the show.<br/><br/>UPDATE: In related news, the Pakistani government has announced plans to build a new border wall – one that's allegedly going to be 10 feet tall and covered in barbed wire. Because nothing says "peace" like a good ol' fashioned Berlin Wall-style barrier.<br/><br/>Related News: Afghanistan's Taliban government has been accused of being as effective at governing as a group of drunken monkeys trying to run a cat cafe. In other news, the United States government is still trying to figure out how to vet Afghan evacuees – mainly because it's like trying to find a needle in a haystack while blindfolded and playing musical chairs.<br/><br/>Stay Tuned: For more updates on this developing story, stick with us!
