        <p>BREAKING: Iran Protests Descend into Chaos as Protesters Chant "We Want More Inflatable Unicorn Horns!"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, protests in Tehran have taken a bizarre turn as demonstrators chant anti-government slogans while waving inflatable unicorn horns. Video verified by BBC Persian shows buildings on fire in the Iranian capital, but not just any ordinary buildings - they're all covered in glitter and playing disco music.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, frustration over the collapse of Iran's currency has triggered demonstrations in more than 100 cities and towns across all 31 provinces, with protesters demanding an end to austerity measures and a return to the good old days of disco dancing. "We want our rials back... or at least a decent souvenir from the gift shop," said one protester, who wished to remain anonymous.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, mosques in the Gholhak and Sa'adat Abad neighbourhoods of Tehran are on fire - but not just any ordinary fires - they're being fueled by a special brand of Iranian BBQ sauce that's supposed to be "extra spicy." Witnesses describe the scene as " absolute pandemonium," with protesters chanting slogans like "We want more inflatables!" and "Disco forever!"<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, a group of protesting Elvis Presleys (yes, plural) were spotted in the midst of the chaos, singing "Can't Help Falling in Love" while shaking their hips. When asked about their involvement, one of the Elvises replied, "We're just here to bring some joy and rock 'n' roll to these fine folks."<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, it remains unclear what exactly will happen next - but one thing's for sure: someone's going to have a lot of explaining to do when the dust settles.<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just in, a group of protesting accountants has arrived on the scene, armed with calculators and a mission to "sort out" the protesters' financial woes. "We're here to bring some fiscal responsibility to these fine folks," said one accountant, who wished to remain anonymous. When asked about the inflatable unicorn horns, they replied, "Oh, those? Just a minor accounting error - we'll get to the bottom of it."</p>
