        <h2>YOU WON'T BELIEVE WHAT JUST HAPPENED TO THE MAN BEHIND IRAN'S MOST DRAMATIC FILMS!</h2>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Bahram Beyzai, the "Little Stranger" of Iranian cinema, has died at 87, leaving behind a legacy of drama-filled films and bespoke suits that will be deeply missed by all who knew him.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BAHRAM BEYZAI, THE LITTLE STRANGER OF IRANIAN CINEMA, DIES AGED 87<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Bahram Beyzai, the Iranian cinema giant and purveyor of all things dramatic, has passed away at the ripe old age of 87. But don't worry, folks, this isn't just any ordinary obituary. Oh no. This is a story about a man who lived life to the fullest, with more drama than a Kardashian family reunion.<br/><br/>As news of his passing spread like wildfire (or should I say, like Beyzai's fiery temper), Iranian newspapers mourned his loss with front-page tributes that read like a Who's Who of Tehran's elite. Prince Reza Pahlavi, the exiled son of the last Shah of Iran, was among those who eulogized Beyzai, saying, "His passing is a great loss for the art and culture of our country... and also for my hairdresser, who can't get him to return his bespoke toupee."<br/><br/>But what really set tongues wagging (or should I say, what really set off the fire alarms?) was Beyzai's remarkable life story. The man was a true original – a playwright, film director, and all-around enfant terrible of Iranian cinema. His films were like a box of chocolates: you never knew what kind of drama you'd get, but one thing was for sure – it would be explosive.<br/><br/>Take his masterpiece, "Bashu, the Little Stranger", for instance. It's a film about a small boy trying to escape the Iran-Iraq war by disguising himself as a girl (because, you know, that always works out well). But what really made this film stand out was Beyzai's ingenious use of special effects – like when Bashu uses his "superpowers" to fly over the desert and save the day. Yeah, it's not like that's been done before.<br/><br/>Beyzai's death sent shockwaves through the Iranian cinema community, with many of his peers taking to social media to pay their respects. Jaafar Panahi, a fellow filmmaker and one-time Beyzai protégé, tweeted, "He taught us how to stand up to oblivion... and also how to write a really good script on no sleep and a bottle of Jack Daniel's."<br/><br/>But even as we mourn the loss of this cinematic giant, we can't help but feel a sense of hope – for Iran, for cinema, and for Beyzai's legendary collection of bespoke suits. After all, as his wife, Mozhdeh Shamsai, said in her eulogy, "Just hearing the word 'Iran' would still bring tears to his eyes... and also to mine, because I'd be thinking about who was going to pay for the catering at his funeral."<br/><br/>In short, Bahram Beyzai may be gone, but his legend lives on – like a bottle of fine Persian wine that's been left in the sun too long. Cheers, old chap!</p>
