        <p>**BREAKING: PASTOR AND NEW BRIDE ABDUCTED IN BIZARRE NIGERIA ATTACKS**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a church was raided in central Nigeria and a wedding party in the mostly Muslim north. But that's not all - a pastor and his new bride were among those abducted! Yes, you read that right... a newlywed couple was taken away by kidnappers while still on their honeymoon.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim the attackers stormed the Cherubim and Seraphim Church in Kogi state, firing shots and forcing congregants to flee in panic. The pastor, his wife (who was still rocking her wedding dress), and several worshippers were seized. It's like something out of a bad action movie!<br/><br/>Meanwhile, in another bizarre incident, a bride and her bridesmaids were kidnapped from their wedding ceremony in Sokoto state. Yes, you guessed it - they were taken while preparing for the big day! The baby momma, the baby itself, and another woman were also among those abducted. It's like the kidnappers just wanted to crash the party!<br/><br/>Schools and places of worship have been increasingly targeted in Nigeria's latest wave of attacks. Analysts believe these are likely carried out by criminal gangs seeking ransom payments. But wait, there's more! Presidential spokesman Nnamdi Kanu (yes, that's a real person) thinks the kidnappings might be the work of jihadist groups. Who knew?<br/><br/>The Kogi state government has promised to "do what they should do" to track down the attackers, but it seems like their security network is about as effective as trying to herd cats on a sugar high.<br/><br/>As one villager put it, "We're too scared to speak after hundreds of schoolchildren were kidnapped." Yeah, that's understandable. Who wouldn't be traumatized by all these kidnappings?<br/><br/>In related news, Nigeria has outlawed paying ransoms in an attempt to stop the lucrative kidnapping industry. But let's be real, who doesn't love a good ransom negotiation? It's like a game of cat and mouse... or in this case, a game of "Keep Away from My Kidnapped Child"!<br/><br/>So there you have it - Pastor Steve and his bride, Debbie, are still missing. If anyone sees them, please call 911 (or the Nigerian equivalent). And to all our readers out there, stay safe, and try not to get kidnapped on your honeymoon!</p>
