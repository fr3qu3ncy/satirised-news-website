        <p>UK and France Promise to Deploy Troops to Ukraine, But Only if They Can Get a Good Deal on the Price of Beer<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the UK and France have announced that they will deploy troops to Ukraine... but only if they can get a good deal on the price of beer.<br/><br/>The announcement was made by Prime Minister Sir Keir Starmer, who was seen swigging down a pint of lager as he spoke. "We're committed to standing with Ukraine for the long-term," he said, "as long as we don't have to pay too much for the drinks at the victory parade."<br/><br/>French President Emmanuel Macron also weighed in on the matter, saying that thousands of troops may be deployed to Ukraine... but only if they can get a good seat at the bar.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky expressed skepticism about the whole thing. "I'm not sure I believe them," he said, "after all, they're just promising to deploy troops and then hoping we'll pay for the beer ourselves."<br/><br/>The announcement was met with confusion by many, including former US President Donald Trump's peace envoys, Steve Witkoff and Jared Kushner. "We largely finished our work on agreeing security protocols," said Witkoff, "but we never discussed the price of beer."<br/><br/>In other news, Russia has vowed to continue its invasion of Ukraine... but only if they can get a good deal on the price of vodka.<br/><br/>Ukraine's President Zelensky: We Need Clear Security Guarantees<br/><br/>In a related story, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has said that he needs clear security guarantees from his allies before he'll agree to a peace deal with Russia. When asked what kind of guarantees he was looking for, Zelensky replied, "Well, it's not just about the beer... although that would be nice."<br/><br/>UK and France Sign Declaration on Deploying Troops<br/><br/>The UK and France have signed a declaration on deploying troops to Ukraine... but only if they can get a good deal on the price of flights.<br/><br/>The agreement was hailed as a huge step forward by many, including Sir Keir Starmer, who said it paves the way for the legal framework under which British, French and partner forces could operate on Ukrainian soil... without having to pay too much for their own airfare.<br/><br/>US Coast Guard Seizes Ship in Waters Between Iceland and Scotland<br/><br/>In other news, the US Coast Guard has seized a ship called the Marinera in waters between Iceland and Scotland. When asked why they had done so, an official replied, "Well, we heard it was carrying a shipment of cheap beer from Denmark."<br/><br/>Trump Discussing Potentially Buying Greenland<br/><br/>And finally, former US President Donald Trump is reportedly discussing potentially buying Greenland... but only if they can get a good deal on the price of ice cream.</p>
