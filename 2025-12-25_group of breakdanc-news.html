        <p>BREAKING: MOSQUE EXPLOSION HITS MAIDUGURI, NIGERIA!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, at least five people were killed and 35 others injured in a massive explosion that rocked the city of Maiduguri during evening prayers. But wait, it gets better!<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that just as the blast occurred, a group of mariachi band members burst into the mosque, singing "La Cucaracha" at the top of their lungs. Witnesses described the scene as "chaotic" and "utterly bizarre."<br/><br/>According to reports, the explosion was so massive that it blew the doors off the mosque, causing a stampede of people trying to escape. However, in a surprising twist, the crowd suddenly parted like the Red Sea, allowing a group of breakdancing ninjas to perform an epic dance routine.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nigerian authorities are still investigating the cause of the blast, but sources close to the investigation say it was likely caused by a faulty light bulb and a can of hairspray left behind by a hipster worshiper.<br/><br/>As the city reels from the shock, residents have taken to social media to express their outrage...and also their amusement. One Twitter user quipped: "Just when you thought things couldn't get any weirder in Maiduguri, a mariachi band shows up and starts playing 'The Chicken Dance' during prayer."<br/><br/>In related news, Boko Haram has released a statement denying any involvement in the blast, but promising to "get back to work on making Nigeria great again...with more explosions!"<br/><br/>UPDATE: The BBC has just reported that the victims of the blast have been taken to a local hospital, where they are receiving treatment from a team of doctors who specialize in treating injuries caused by unexpected dance routines.<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY!</p>
