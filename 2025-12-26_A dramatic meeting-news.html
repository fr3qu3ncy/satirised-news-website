        <p>BREAKING: Zelensky to Meet Trump in Florida for Talks on Ending Russian War<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has announced that he will be meeting US President Donald Trump in Florida this weekend to discuss the ending of Russia's full-scale war. Yes, you read that right – Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States and self-proclaimed expert on everything.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Ukrainian leader, Zelensky is hoping to convince Trump to use his negotiating powers to broker a deal between Ukraine and Russia. We're not sure what kind of leverage Trump has in this situation, but hey, it's worth a shot, right?<br/><br/>As part of the talks, Zelensky plans to pitch Trump on his "20-point peace plan," which is reportedly 90% complete (because who needs details when you're making history?). The plan includes such radical ideas as establishing a demilitarized zone in eastern Ukraine and creating a "free economic zone" – because what's more appealing to a businessman like Trump than the prospect of free money?<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! Trump has already weighed in on the situation, saying that Zelensky doesn't have anything until he approves it. Because who needs Ukrainian sovereignty when you've got Donald Trump making decisions for them? And to add some extra insult to injury, Trump also mentioned that he expects to speak with Russian President Vladimir Putin "soon" – because why not?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the people of Ukraine are just trying to survive amidst the ongoing war. In a separate development, two people were killed and several others wounded in a Russian air strike on Kharkiv earlier today. But hey, who needs human lives when you've got Twitter to distract you from the horrors of war?<br/><br/>In related news, Trump also announced that Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu will be visiting him in the coming days. Because what's more important than making a deal with Ukraine when you can have a chat with the leader of Israel about... well, who knows what? The mysteries of the universe are endless!<br/><br/>And just to top it all off, Putin's senior aides held talks with US officials over the phone, and Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov was quoted as saying that December 25, 2025, will be remembered as a milestone in the quest for peace. Yeah, good luck with that – we're sure it'll be just peachy to have a war-torn country at your doorstep on Christmas morning.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the War Against Reality and the ongoing struggle for sanity in the face of global chaos!</p>
