        <p>BREAKING: CUBA DECLARES WAR ON VENEZUELA...OR WAS IT THE OTHER WAY AROUND?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Cuban government has announced that 32 of its nationals were killed during a US operation to seize Venezuelan leader Nicolás Maduro. Because, you know, it's not like they had anything better to do in Cuba.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, we made that up), the Cubans were providing protection to Maduro and his wife, Cilia Flores, who was seen sipping margaritas with a straw while her husband was being dragged away by US forces. Sources close to the Cuban government (also made up) claim that the country's armed forces had been "in combat actions" against the attackers, but really they were just trying to get to the last donut in the box.<br/><br/>US President Donald Trump, who was seen wearing a "Make Venezuela Great Again" hat, tweeted his congratulations to the US military for a job well done. However, things took a turn when he accidentally posted a selfie with the Venezuelan president's wife, saying "I'm not sure who's more embarrassed, me or Cilia". We're still trying to figure out what happened there.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Venezuela's armed forces have said that a "large part" of Maduro's security team were among the casualties. When asked for comment, Maduro's spokesperson replied, "Well, it's not like we had a plan in place for this kind of thing...oh wait, we totally did." <br/><br/>The US government has since announced plans to invade Cuba, but only after they've finished binge-watching Netflix shows and eating pizza. According to sources (okay, we made that up again), the invasion will be led by a team of highly trained ninjas who have been secretly training in the art of...wait for it...cuban dancing.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which is probably just going to end with everyone getting along and having a margarita together.</p>
