        <p>EU LEADERS DECIDE ON LOANING RUSSIA'S FROZEN ASSETS TO UKRAINE, BUT NOT BEFORE A SPOOKY ENCOUNTER WITH THE CHUCK NORRIS<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, EU leaders were seen frantically searching for their missing socks during the Brussels summit. The sudden appearance of Chuck Norris in the room caused quite a commotion, as he proceeded to roundhouse kick the conference table, sending papers and pens flying everywhere.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky was heard exclaiming, "We must agree on this loan by the end of the year, or else I'll have to reduce production of drones...and trust me, you don't want that happening!" He then burst into an impromptu dance routine, much to the surprise of the assembled leaders.<br/><br/>The EU Commission chief, Ursula von der Leyen, vowed, "We will not leave this summit without a solution, or else we'll have to answer to our mothers-in-law...and trust me, you don't want that happening either!"<br/><br/>As tensions mounted, Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk appeared out of nowhere, wearing a bright orange jumpsuit and shouting, "I've got an idea! Let's use Russia's frozen assets as a giant game of Monopoly! We can roll the dice, move our pieces...it'll be like a real-life board game!"<br/><br/>Belgian Prime Minister Bart De Wever was overheard whispering to his colleague, "If we agree on this loan, we might just have to start wearing funny hats and singing 'We Are the Champions' with Freddie Mercury's ghost."<br/><br/>Just when it seemed things couldn't get any weirder, US President Donald Trump (who had somehow managed to sneak into the meeting) chimed in with, "Folks, let me tell you, this loan is going to be yuge. Just yuge. Believe me, nobody knows more about loans than I do."<br/><br/>As the summit drew to a close, EU leaders were seen huddled around a makeshift poker table, betting on whether or not Russia would actually respond to their peace proposals.<br/><br/>And in the midst of all this chaos, President Putin was heard grumbling from Moscow, "Those European piglets are at it again...trying to profit from my collapse. I'll show them...with my army of dancing bears!"<br/><br/>STAY TUNED FOR FURTHER UPDATES ON THIS DEVELOPING STORY</p>
