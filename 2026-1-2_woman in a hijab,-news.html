        <p>CONTAMINATED TAP WATER EPIDEMIC SPREADS IN INDIA<br/><br/>Indore, India - In a shocking turn of events, the city's residents have been forced to endure a severe outbreak of diarrhoea caused by contaminated tap water. And in a bizarre twist, officials claim that four people have died due to this epidemic, while families are alleging that the actual toll is higher... and we're not talking about just humans.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses report seeing a group of elephants in the area, who were seen dancing to Bollywood music, possibly contracted the disease from drinking tap water. "I was just trying to get some milk for my latte when I saw these elephants doing the Bhangra," said local resident, Kumar. "Next thing I know, they're all vomiting and having diarrhoea."<br/><br/>The authorities have since issued a statement saying that the contamination was caused by a leak in the sewage system, which mixed with drinking water, leading to the outbreak. But here's the thing: the Prime Minister of India has just announced that he is taking a break from governing the country to go on a world tour of "best tap waters". When asked about this move, officials replied, "Well, someone's got to drink all those fancy bottled waters."<br/><br/>Locals claim that they had been complaining about the stinky water for months before the outbreak. "We told them it was bad news," said Sudha Pal, a resident of Bhagirathpura. "But no one listened... until everyone started shitting everywhere." Now, residents are forced to live on bottled water and instant noodles. As one local said, "It's like being stuck in a never-ending loop of MasterChef."<br/><br/>The government has promised to increase funding for the city's water infrastructure, but only after they've finished setting up a new tap water tasting committee featuring a special appearance by Gordon Ramsay.<br/><br/>In related news, India's largest pizza chain, Domino's, has announced that they will be offering a "Contaminated Tap Water Special" as a limited-time promotion. A spokesperson said, "We're trying to capitalize on the situation... and also serve some really dirty pizzas."</p>
