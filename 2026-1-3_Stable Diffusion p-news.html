        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Bizarre Warning Sparks Chaos in Iran<br/><br/>In a shocking move, Donald Trump warned that the US will "come to the rescue" of peaceful protesters in Iran who are being killed by their government. Because, you know, that's exactly what happened last time someone tried to interfere with a country's internal affairs... said no one ever.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation (okay, fine, it was just a guy on Twitter), Trump tweeted: "If Iran shoots and violently kills peaceful protesters, which is their custom, the United States of America will come to their rescue." Because nothing says "rescue" like a tweet with a bunch of typos.<br/><br/>Iran's Foreign Minister Abbas Araghchi quickly responded by saying that Trump's comments were "reckless and dangerous," adding that Iran's armed forces are on standby and know exactly where to aim. Yeah, because who needs diplomacy when you've got Twitter?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian said he'll listen to the protesters' "legitimate demands," but only if they promise not to riot too much. And by "riot too much," we mean just a little bit.<br/><br/>As the protests continue in Iran, things have taken a turn for the weird. In a bizarre twist, a group of dolphins was spotted swimming through the streets of Tehran, chanting slogans against the government. Okay, maybe that didn't happen... or did it?<br/><br/>In other news, Iranian police spokesman Brigadier General Saeed Montazern has announced that his officers will "forcefully reject any interference in their internal affairs." Which is code for: "We'll shoot anyone who gets in our way, including dolphins."<br/><br/>And because you can never have too much drama, sources close to the White House (okay, fine, it was just a friend of a friend) say that Trump's warning may actually be a clever ploy to distract from his recent announcement that he'll "run" Venezuela until they get their act together. Because who needs international diplomacy when you've got... uh, running?<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The US and Iran: where the only thing more unpredictable than the situation is Trump's hairdo.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: In a shocking turn of events (just kidding, we saw this coming), Iranian President Masoud Pezeshkian has announced that he'll be hosting a press conference to address the "dolphin situation." We're not sure what to expect, but we're pretty sure it'll involve a lot of backpedaling.<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>SIDEBAR: In related news, a group of accountants in Tehran have been working overtime to calculate the economic impact of Trump's warning. According to sources (okay, fine, it was just a guy named Bob), they've determined that the US will save approximately 47 billion rials by not sending troops to Iran. But let's be real, folks: who's counting at this point?<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>AND FINALLY: If you're wondering what Trump's next move will be, don't worry – we have a crystal ball (just kidding, it's just a Magic 8-Ball). According to our sources (okay, fine, it was just a friend of a friend), Trump plans to tweet about the whole situation and use at least three emojis. Stay tuned!</p>
