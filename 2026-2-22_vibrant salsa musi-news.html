        <p>His Career Spanned 60 Years, Dozens of Albums, and a Few Spontaneous Dance Parties with His Cat - We Remember the One and Only Willie Colón<br/><br/>Willie Colón, the trombonist who single-handedly kept salsa music alive for decades, has left us to join the great cloud of jazz legends. Or maybe he just went to get some nachos.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the family (and by "sources" we mean his cat), Willie passed away peacefully on Saturday morning after a long battle with... um, getting old. His family released a statement saying that he died surrounded by his loving family, including his wife Julia and their 17 kids (just kidding, it was just three).<br/><br/>Colón's career spanned an impressive 60 years, during which time he managed to release dozens of albums, most of which were simply titled "El Malo" but with different subtitles (e.g. "The Really Bad One," "The Super Duper Extraordinary Bad One"). He also had a successful side hustle as a producer, working with the likes of Celia Cruz and Ismael Miranda.<br/><br/>But what really set Willie apart was his ability to make salsa music cool again in the 1970s, much like a teenager's ability to make avocado toast seem interesting. His iconic trombone playing was so influential that it spawned an entire genre - "New York Sound" - which is just a fancy way of saying "music that makes you want to dance with your shoes on."<br/><br/>We remember Willie Colón for many things: his legendary beard, his impeccable taste in music (he was always down for a good trombone solo), and his uncanny ability to make even the grumpiest person smile. He once said, "I'm not just a musician, I'm a salsa evangelist - spreading the gospel of good vibes and bad beats."<br/><br/>As we bid farewell to this musical legend, we can't help but wonder what he'd say if he were here today. Would he shout "¡Viva el malo!" one last time? Would he break into an impromptu dance party with his cat, Mr. Whiskers? Only Willie Colón knew for sure.<br/><br/>Rest in peace, Willie. May your trombone always be full of air and your salsa always be hot.<br/><br/>A Brief Tribute to Willie Colón's Life and Career<br/><br/>* Born: April 28, 1950 (according to his birth certificate, which he probably had tattooed on his forehead)<br/>* Died: When he finally got tired of playing the trombone<br/>* Musician: Yes, but also a part-time superhero who saved salsa music from itself<br/>* Legacy: A trail of salsa-scented nachos that will forever be remembered as "Willie's Nachos"<br/>* Cats: 12 (each with its own Instagram account)<br/>* Awards: 10 Grammy nominations, 15 gold records, and a few participation trophies for "Best Use of Trombone in a Salsa Song"<br/><br/>Rest in peace, Willie Colón. Your trombone will be missed.</p>
