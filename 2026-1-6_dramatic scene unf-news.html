        <p>BREAKING: Russia's Energy Sector Under Attack by Ukrainian Drones, US Threatens to Annex Greenland, and Macron Hosts a Very Special Meeting<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Russia has escalated its attacks on Ukraine's energy sector, which can only be described as a real "power" move. Meanwhile, the US has threatened to annex Greenland, because why not? It's not like Denmark is going to stop them or anything.<br/><br/>French President Emmanuel Macron is hosting a very special meeting in Paris, where leaders from over 30 countries are gathered to discuss security guarantees for Ukraine. The talks are being led by Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and his trusty sidekick, Steve Witkoff, who's also known as the "US Peace Negotiator" ( Patent pending).<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! US President Donald Trump has sent his son-in-law Jared Kushner to negotiate with Russia on behalf of the US. Because, you know, nothing says "diplomacy" like a 35-year-old man-child trying to talk sense into Vladimir Putin.<br/><br/>The meeting is being held under the shadow of the US's military action in Venezuela, where elite troops went in to seize President Nicolás Maduro and take him to face charges in New York. Because who needs international law when you've got a good PR team?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Trump has also threatened to annex Greenland, because why not? It's not like Denmark is going to stop them or anything. Danish Prime Minister Mette Frederiksen has said that any such move would be the end of the trans-Atlantic alliance, but let's be real, who needs allies when you've got a Twitter account?<br/><br/>UK Prime Minister Keir Starmer and Nato Secretary General Mark Rutte are also attending the meeting, trying to figure out how to save Ukraine from Russia's clutches. But honestly, who cares? It's not like they're going to do anything about it.<br/><br/>In other news, a man was spotted walking his dog near the site of a Russian drone strike on a private medical clinic in Ukraine. He was wearing a hat and gloves and looked really cute trying to navigate through the snow.<br/><br/>Related Stories:<br/><br/>* A group of skiers created a heart-shaped tribute for the victims of the Switzerland forest fire, because who doesn't love a good snowman?<br/>* A man in court was charged with the murder of a Donegal businessman, but honestly, who's keeping track?<br/>* The painful questions for NATO and the EU as Trump threatens Greenland are still being asked, but nobody has any answers.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story!</p>
