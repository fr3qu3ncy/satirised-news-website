        <p>BREAKING: Mass Shooting Erupts at South African Hostel, 11 Killed Including 3-Year-Old<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, a group of heavily armed accountants stormed a hostel near Pretoria, South Africa, and opened fire on a group of partying seniors from the local AARP chapter. The attack left 11 people dead, including a 3-year-old toddler who was enjoying his first-ever piña colada.<br/><br/>Eyewitnesses claim that the gunmen, dressed in business attire and armed with nothing but calculators and briefcases, burst into the hostel at around 4:30 AM, shouting "We're here for the early bird special!" before unleashing a hail of bullets on the unsuspecting seniors.<br/><br/>"I was just trying to get my morning coffee when suddenly I heard the sound of gunfire and people screaming," said Jane Doe, a witness who managed to escape the carnage. "I turned around and saw these guys in suits running around, shouting 'We're from the IRS!'"<br/><br/>Police spokesperson Brigadier Athlenda Mathe confirmed that at least 11 people were killed in the attack, including three-year-old Timmy Jenkins, who was celebrating his birthday with a party hat and a plate of cookies.<br/><br/>"We are investigating this incident as a possible case of mass hysteria," said Mathe. "It's not uncommon for people to get excited when they see a group of heavily armed accountants bursting into a room."<br/><br/>The motive behind the attack remains unclear, but sources close to the investigation suggest that it may have been a case of mistaken identity.<br/><br/>"It turns out that the accountants were actually on their way to a meeting with a group of senior citizens to discuss the finer points of tax law," said Mathe. "Unfortunately, they got confused and ended up at the wrong party."<br/><br/>As the nation mourns the loss of these innocent lives, one thing is clear: never underestimate the power of a good accounting firm.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The FBI has released a statement saying that they are "looking into" the possibility of a connection between this attack and a recent surge in popularity of accountant-themed memes on social media.<br/><br/>Related Stories<br/><br/>* "Accountant Arrested for Stealing Donuts from Coworkers"<br/>* "Local Businessman Accused of Using Too Many Clichés in Speech"<br/>* "New Study Reveals That Accountants Are, in Fact, Secretly Ninja Warriors"</p>
