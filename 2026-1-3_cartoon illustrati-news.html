        <p>BREAKING: Trump Announces Venezuela Takeover, But Things Get Weird Fast<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, President Donald Trump announced that the US will be running Venezuela like it's a theme park until "a proper transition can take place." But, things got weird when Trump added that he plans to bring in a team of expert line-dancers from Texas to "keep everyone's spirits high."<br/><br/>"We're going to run this country like we're running a taco truck," Trump said in a press conference. "We'll have Nicolas Maduro and his wife, Celia, performing a choreographed dance routine every morning at 6am sharp. It'll be tremendous, believe me."<br/><br/>The US military launched strikes against Venezuela's capital city of Caracas, but things took a turn for the absurd when they accidentally bombed a mariachi band that was playing in the streets.<br/><br/>"We didn't mean to hit them," said General John Kelly, "but they were just so... festive. We couldn't resist joining in."<br/><br/>As the US military takes control of Venezuela, they're implementing a new policy: all citizens must wear funny hats on Tuesdays and Thursdays. It's called "Hat-uation Tuesday" and is meant to boost morale.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nicolas Maduro and his wife have been taken into custody by the US authorities. When asked what they'll be doing during their time in prison, Maduro replied, "We'll be learning how to do the cha cha slide like Donald Trump taught us."<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, Attorney General Pam Bondi announced that Maduro will face charges for "making everyone's eyes roll so hard with his speeches." The US government has set up a special task force to prosecute all crimes related to excessive eye-rolling.<br/><br/>As the situation continues to spiral out of control, one thing is certain: Venezuela has officially become the world's most interesting theme park.</p>
