        <p>Polar Bears on Norwegian Islands Fatter and Healthier Despite Ice Loss, Scientists Say (But Only Because They've Discovered a Love for Pizza Parties)<br/><br/>6 hours ago ShareSave Victoria GillScience correspondent ShareSave Watch: The BBC's Victoria Gill looks at why are these Norwegian polar bears getting fatter<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, scientists have discovered that the polar bears on the Norwegian Arctic archipelago of Svalbard have become fatter and healthier since the early 1990s. And it's not because they've been eating more fish or berries – it's because they've developed a secret love for pizza parties.<br/><br/>Researchers weighed and measured 770 adults in Svalbard between 1992 and 2019, and found that bears had become significantly fatter. They think that Svalbard bears have adapted to recent ice loss by attending weekly pizza parties on the island of Longyearbyen, where they indulge in a diet of cheese, pepperoni, and garlic bread.<br/><br/>"It's a polar bear paradise," said lead researcher Dr Jon Aars from the Norwegian Polar Institute. "We're not sure how they managed to get their paws on a Domino's delivery guy, but it seems they've found a new way to supplement their seal-based diet."<br/><br/>According to sources close to the research team, the bears have been sneaking into the local pizza parlor at night, where they enjoy a feast of pizza, wings, and beer. "It's like they're trying to make up for lost time," said Aars. "And who can blame them? Pizza is the perfect food for polar bears – it's high in calories, low in nutrition, and totally Instagrammable."<br/><br/>But don't worry, this newfound love for pizza isn't hurting their health. In fact, researchers say that the bears' fat reserves have increased by up to 30% since the early 1990s. "It's like they're getting a free spa day every time they eat a slice," said Aars.<br/><br/>The discovery has left scientists stunned, but also a little concerned. As the sea ice continues to decline, the bears may need to travel further to access their pizza supply, which could deplete precious fat reserves and lead to... well, you know – a hangry polar bear is not a pretty sight.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the local pizza parlor has seen a surge in business since the discovery. "We're doing brisk business every night," said the owner, who wished to remain anonymous. "Polar bears are the best customers – they leave great reviews on Yelp and always tip their waiters."<br/><br/>Update: We've received reports that a group of polar bears have been spotted attempting to order a large pepperoni pizza with extra cheese and a side of Arctic Char wings. When asked for comment, Dr Aars simply shrugged and said, "Well, when you're living in the Arctic, you've got to make do with what's available."</p>
