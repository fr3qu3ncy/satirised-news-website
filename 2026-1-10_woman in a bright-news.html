        <p>BREAKING: "Mountain of Rubbish" Collapses in Philippines, Dozens Missing and 4 Dead - But Don't Worry, It's Just a Typical Thursday<br/><br/>Cebu, Philippines - In a shocking turn of events, a mountain of rubbish collapsed at a landfill site in the central Philippines, leaving dozens missing and four dead. But don't worry, folks, it's just another day in paradise!<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, they might not be entirely sure what happened), the landslide occurred when a group of highly trained waste management professionals decided to have a mid-morning snack amidst the towering pile of trash. Who knew that churros and soda could be so explosive?<br/><br/>"We were just having a little picnic in the garbage, you know, enjoying the scenic views and the fresh air... and then, BAM! The whole mountain came crashing down!" exclaimed one eyewitness, who wished to remain anonymous (but let's be real, it was probably someone named "Bubba").<br/><br/>As rescue workers rushed to the scene, they found themselves facing a sea of trash - literally. It's like the landfill decided to stage its own personal version of "The Great Gatsby" party, complete with a massive cake made entirely out of banana peels and discarded pizza boxes.<br/><br/>"We're doing our best to locate the missing workers," said Mayor Nestor Archival, who looked like he'd just sucked on a lemon. "But honestly, it's not looking good. We've got teams searching for survivors, but so far, all we've found are some really cool trash-themed sculptures."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, relatives of the missing workers have been gathered at the landfill site, anxiously waiting for news of their loved ones. One relative, Jerahmey Espinoza, was overheard saying, "I just want my husband back... or at least a decent refund on our Netflix subscription."<br/><br/>As the rescue efforts continue, authorities are urging residents to remain calm and not panic. But let's be real, folks - when you're talking about a landfill collapsing in the Philippines, it's basically just another Tuesday.<br/><br/>UPDATE:<br/><br/>The cause of the collapse remains unclear, but experts speculate that it might have been caused by poor waste management practices... or maybe it was just a giant pile of garbage trying to make a break for it.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story!</p>
