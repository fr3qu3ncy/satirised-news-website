        <p>A series of explosions in Iran resulted in 14 injured and 9 dead, but don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom because there are also some pretty hilarious Twitter reactions and a great excuse for a mischievous leprechaun named Paddy O'Malley to pull off his next prank.</p>

        <p>BREAKING: Fourteen people are reportedly injured after separate blasts were reported on Saturday, but it's not all doom and gloom!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, two explosions rocked the lovely city of Bandar Abbas in Iran on Saturday. But don't worry, folks, it's not as bad as it sounds. I mean, who needs functioning infrastructure or a stable government when you can have CHAOS?!<br/><br/>According to sources (okay, fine, they're just random people on Twitter), the explosions were caused by a gas leak... and also possibly a mischievous leprechaun named Paddy O'Malley, but let's not get too caught up in details.<br/><br/>One blast happened at a residential building, which is code for "a bunch of apartments that haven't been renovated since the Clinton administration." The building was destroyed, along with several vehicles and shops. I mean, who needs a functioning economy when you can have... wait, what was I saying?<br/><br/>Anyway, Five people were killed in the blast, but on the bright side, the survivors got to experience the thrill of being rescued by a team of heroic firefighters! It's like a scene straight out of Baywatch!<br/><br/>The second explosion occurred in Ahvaz, which is just a fancy way of saying "that one place you forget exists." Four people were killed there, but on the plus side, they got to enjoy the scenic views of rubble and destruction. I mean, who needs a peaceful life when you can have... well, you get the idea.<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better!<br/><br/>Donald Trump, the most famous and greatest president ever (in his own mind), had some thoughts on the matter. In a press conference that was totally not scripted at all, he said: "I certainly can't tell you that." When asked if he'd decided what to do about Iran, he replied: "Oh, I'm just winging it, folks! Who needs diplomacy when you have Twitter?"<br/><br/>Trump also mentioned that the US had "very big powerful ships" in the region. You know, the kind that are totally not being used as a prop to distract from his latest tweetstorm.<br/><br/>And let's not forget about the real heroes of this story:<br/><br/>The Qatari prime minister and Iran's Supreme National Security Council head met in Tehran on Saturday. I'm pretty sure they were discussing something super important, like who got the last donut at the meeting or whether to wear socks with sandals.<br/><br/>But in all seriousness (just for a second), it seems like everyone is trying to calm things down and have a nice cup of tea while negotiating over the fate of the Middle East. How quaint!<br/><br/>So, to sum it up: Two explosions happened, five people died, but on the bright side, there's now a great excuse for Paddy O'Malley's next prank!</p>
