        <p>BREAKING: Iran's Supreme Leader's Compound Hit by Surprise Strike; Retaliatory Missiles Fired at Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and UAE<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the compound of Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei has been destroyed in a surprise strike launched by the US and Israel. The attack, which was preceded by weeks of threats from Donald Trump, has sent shockwaves throughout the Middle East.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses, the strikes were so powerful that they caused a massive explosion at the compound, leaving a giant crater and a trail of destruction in its wake. Witnesses claim that Khamenei's prized possession, his famous cat, Mr. Whiskers, was seen fleeing the scene with a "look of utter terror" on its face.<br/><br/>The Iranian government has responded to the attack by launching a retaliatory strike against targets across the Middle East, including Qatar, Bahrain, Kuwait, and the UAE. The missiles were fired from Iran's secret underground lair, hidden deep beneath the sands of the desert.<br/><br/>In a bizarre twist, it was revealed that the retaliation was led by none other than Chuck Norris himself, who appeared on the scene dressed in a pair of oversized sunglasses and a leather jacket, shouting "Come on, Iran! You're going down!"<br/><br/>As the situation continues to unfold, officials from the US and Israel have issued statements claiming that the attacks were necessary to prevent an imminent threat from Iran. Trump, meanwhile, has been seen tweeting furiously about the strikes, using hashtags like #MakeIranGreatAgain and #MAGA4Ever.<br/><br/>In related news, the Iranian Red Crescent Society has announced that 201 people have been killed and 747 injured in the US and Israeli strikes. However, sources close to the organization claim that these numbers are actually much higher, but were suppressed due to a "minor accounting error."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the people of Iran have taken to the streets to protest the attacks, waving signs that read "Death to America" and "Freedom for Mr. Whiskers." The protests have been peaceful so far, although reports suggest that some protesters have been spotted dancing the Macarena in support of Chuck Norris's leadership.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for further updates on this developing story, which promises to be one of the most epic conflicts of all time.<br/><br/>UPDATE: As of press time, it has been announced that David Hasselhoff has arrived on the scene to broker a peace deal between the warring parties. Sources close to the negotiations claim that the Hoff is using his famous "Hoff power" to negotiate a ceasefire and a promise from Iran to never again threaten to nuke the world.<br/><br/>UPDATE 2: Chuck Norris's Twitter account has been hacked by Iranian hackers, who have posted a message claiming that the actor has been captured by Iranian forces and is being forced to watch an endless loop of cat videos. However, sources close to Norris claim that he was actually just filming a commercial for his new line of beard care products.</p>
