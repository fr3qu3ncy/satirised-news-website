        <p>INDONESIA FLOODS: THE APOCALYPSE THAT WASN'T<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the recent flooding in Indonesia has been declared a complete and utter disaster - but not because of the actual destruction caused by the floods. No, it's much worse than that.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (who were all wearing matching "I survived the apocalypse" t-shirts), the real tragedy was the complete lack of pineapples available for snacking during the ordeal. "It was like the end times," said one survivor, who wished to remain anonymous but was overheard muttering something about needing a stiff drink and a good Netflix series. "We had nothing but muddy water and despair. It was a true nightmare."<br/><br/>The situation was further complicated by the unexpected appearance of a group of line-dancing cowboys from Texas, who were in the area for a publicity stunt gone wrong. "We just wanted to bring a little bit of country flair to the region," said Buckaroo Bill, leader of the group. "But things took a turn for the worse when we realized our cowboy boots weren't designed for wading through waist-deep mud."<br/><br/>As rescue teams struggled to reach those stranded by the floods, they were confronted with an unexpected challenge: the villagers' strong dislike of being helped. "It's all very well to send aid and volunteers," said one local resident, "but what we really need is a decent coffee shop that serves more than just instant noodles."<br/><br/>The Indonesian government has promised to take swift action to address the crisis, including deploying an emergency team of espresso machine operators and installing new drainage systems - which will hopefully be designed with the line-dancing cowboys in mind.<br/><br/>In related news, the global pine-fruit shortage has been declared a national emergency.</p>
