        <p>KENYAN FAMILIES DEMAND THEIR SONS BE BROUGHT HOME FROM RUSSIA... WITH FRIES<br/><br/>Nairobi, Kenya - In a shocking turn of events, Kenyan families are demanding their sons be brought home from Russia, but not before they've had their fill of combat and a decent serving of fries. Yes, you read that right - fries.<br/><br/>According to eyewitnesses (okay, it was Susan Kuloba's neighbor's cousin), David Kuloba, 22, thought he'd landed the job of a lifetime as a security guard in Russia. That is, until he discovered he'd been duped into fighting for Putin's army. The young Kenyan had been promised $7,000 (or "a gazillion shillings" as Susan put it) on arrival - a life-changing sum that would've bought him a small island in the Caribbean.<br/><br/>However, things took a turn for the worse when David was ambushed by Russian forces and sent to fight in Ukraine. His mother, Susan, says she's been trying to get him back ever since, but the Russians just won't return her calls (or texts... or carrier pigeons).<br/><br/>"I'm not asking for much," said Susan, tearfully. "Just my son back home, with a side of fries and a happy heart."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, another Kenyan family is demanding their son be brought home from Russia as well - but this time, they're not just asking for David; they're asking for a 10-piece bucket of KFC and a complimentary Coke.<br/><br/>"We thought he was going to be a driver," said the father, in a rare interview. "Not a soldier! And definitely not one who's been sent to fight in Ukraine with only two weeks' training!"<br/><br/>The Kenyan government has since launched an investigation into several recruitment agencies that lure young people with promises of large payments and a free trip to Russia (where they get to enjoy the country's infamous hospitality... and combat).<br/><br/>"We're doing everything we can to bring our sons home," said the government spokesperson. "But honestly, can someone just order us some fries? We've been trying for hours."<br/><br/>And so, it seems that Kenyan families are fighting not only against Russia but also against their stomachs - all they want is for their sons to come back home with a good story and a full belly.<br/><br/>UPDATE<br/><br/>Kenya's president has since tweeted: "Just had the most epic conversation with @KFC. We're getting a 10-piece bucket delivered to the Russian embassy in Nairobi. If that doesn't bring our sons back home, nothing will #FriesForPeace"<br/><br/>And Susan Kuloba? She's just been spotted dancing down the streets of Kibera, waving a "Free Fries for Kenyans" sign and chanting: "We want our fries! We want our fries!"</p>
