        <p>Videos Show That Unrest Has Spread to More Than 50 Towns and Cities, Including Pro-Government Heartlands...and Some Weird Stuff<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, protests have broken out in at least 17 of Iran's 31 provinces, leaving authorities scrambling to keep up with the chaos. But wait, it gets better! The unrest has spread rapidly across the country since December 28th, when people got angry about something (we're not quite sure what, but we're guessing it was probably a fresh devaluation of the currency...or maybe just because they were tired of eating the same old Iranian bread for breakfast).<br/><br/>Videos Show Unrest in More Than 50 Towns and Cities<br/><br/>Our intrepid BBC team has managed to verify footage from over 50 towns and cities across Iran, including some previously thought to be pro-government strongholds. Yes, you read that right - more than 50! That's like, a whole lotta protesting going on. We're not sure what's more surprising: the sheer scale of the unrest or the fact that people are still managing to find time for cat videos amidst all the chaos.<br/><br/>Protests Even Break Out in Qom and Mashhad<br/><br/>We're talking about Qom and Mashhad here, folks - two cities that have traditionally been super loyal to the state. Imagine if you told your grandma that Qom and Mashhad were now hubs of anti-government activity...she'd probably just shake her head and mutter something about "kids these days."<br/><br/>The People Are Revolting (and So Is the Weather)<br/><br/>According to our sources, the protests have been accompanied by an unusual weather phenomenon - a sudden outbreak of sunshine in previously cloudy areas. Coincidence? We think not! The people are revolting, and so is Mother Nature.<br/><br/>Government Response: More Violence, Less Tolerance<br/><br/>As tensions rise, authorities have started cracking down on protesters with increasing ferocity. In one shocking incident, security forces were seen firing shots towards a hospital in Ilam city - because, you know, what's more intimidating than being shot at while trying to get some medical attention? And don't even get us started on the fact that Iran's president has ordered an investigation into the whole thing...yeah right.<br/><br/>Peyman Jafari, Assistant Professor of International Relations (and Our New BFF)<br/><br/>We reached out to Peyman Jafari for comment, and he told us: "Escalating repression is likely to deepen popular resentment toward the political system while risking fatigue and demoralisation within the police and security forces - who, at some point, may cease to comply with orders." Translation: things are about to get really ugly.<br/><br/>So What's Next?<br/><br/>Well, it looks like the government is in for a wild ride. Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story...and possibly a few cat videos thrown in for good measure.</p>
