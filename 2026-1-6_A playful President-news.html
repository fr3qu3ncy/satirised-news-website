        <p>SELFIES, SMILES, AND SAUSAGE ROLLS: SOUTH KOREA'S LEE JAE MYUNG GETS COZY WITH CHINA'S XI JINPING<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, South Korea's President Lee Jae Myung has been snapped taking selfies with China's Xi Jinping, while on a four-day visit to Beijing. And it seems the two leaders are not just bonding over their love of smartphones - they're also discussing ways to strengthen ties between their countries.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the meeting (okay, it was probably just Lee Jae Myung himself), the selfie-taking session was a crucial part of the negotiations. "We wanted to show that we're committed to this new phase in South Korea-China relations," said Lee, flashing a cheesy grin for the camera. "And what's more committed than taking a selfie with the President of China?"<br/><br/>But it wasn't all fun and games - the two leaders also discussed ways to strengthen security ties between their countries. And by "security ties", we mean China promised not to hack into South Korea's computer systems (anymore, that is).<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Lee Jae Myung has been spotted enjoying a plate of sausage rolls in Beijing, courtesy of Xi Jinping himself. When asked about the snack, Lee replied, "Ah, yes! The President of China knew I had a weakness for spicy snacks, and he wanted to make me feel at home."<br/><br/>And speaking of homes, it seems that Lee Jae Myung is planning on taking his wife, Kim, shopping in Beijing's famous markets. When asked about their plans, Kim replied, "Oh, we're just going to get some souvenirs - maybe a few knock-off designer handbags and some fake Rolexes."<br/><br/>But not everyone is happy about the warm relations between South Korea and China. In fact, Prime Minister Sanae Takaichi of Japan has been making headlines with her criticism of Xi Jinping's plans for world domination (okay, that might be an exaggeration - but she does think he's trying to control the world's supply of rice).<br/><br/>"China is just trying to distract us from their true intentions," said Prime Minister Takaichi. "They want to take over the world... or at least the Asian continent."<br/><br/>And in a bizarre twist, North Korea has announced that they will be firing hypersonic missiles into space - as a way of celebrating Lee Jae Myung's visit to China.<br/><br/>"We just wanted to join in on the fun," said Kim Jong Un, leader of North Korea. "Plus, we heard there was going to be a party and we didn't want to miss out."<br/><br/>So there you have it - South Korea and China are getting cozy, while Japan is getting anxious, and North Korea is... well, just being its usual self.<br/><br/>AND IN OTHER NEWS<br/><br/>* The world's largest sausage roll has been spotted in Beijing, courtesy of Xi Jinping.<br/>* Lee Jae Myung has announced plans to visit a Chinese water park during his stay - where he will ride the world's tallest waterslide (while wearing a tutu).<br/>* North Korea has launched a new line of clothing inspired by their love of missiles. They call it "Kim Jong Un Chic".<br/>* South Korean business leaders are meeting with China's Premier Li Qiang to discuss ways to increase trade between the two countries - and to get a sneak peek at his secret stash of saucy souvenirs.<br/>* And finally, Lee Jae Myung has announced plans to start a new YouTube channel where he will share his favorite selfie-taking tips and tricks.</p>
