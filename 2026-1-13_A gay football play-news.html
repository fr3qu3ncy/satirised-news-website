        <h2>YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH! Adelaide United's Embarrassing Excuse For Sidelining Gay Player EXPOSED!</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Adelaide United has hilariously tried to cover up alleged internal homophobia by claiming their team selection decisions are made solely on "footballing grounds," which is just code for "we're embarrassed you're gay."</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>CATEGORICALLY REJECTING THE REJECTION: ADLAIDE UNITED SAYS "YOU CAN'T HANDLE THE TRUTH!"<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Adelaide United has categorically rejected claims made by former player Josh Cavallo that he was sidelined due to internal homophobia. But don't worry, folks, it's not like they're trying to cover up anything... oh wait.<br/><br/>It all started when Josh Cavallo, the first man to come out as gay while playing top-tier football, alleged on Instagram that Adelaide United officials had pushed him aside because of his sexuality. And by "pushed him aside," we mean they probably just got tired of his dad jokes and decided to bench him for a good old-fashioned snooze fest.<br/><br/>But fear not, dear readers! The Adelaide United spokesperson has come out swinging (pun intended) with a statement that reads: "All on-field decisions relating to team selection are made solely on footballing grounds." Which is code for: "Yeah, we were just trying to protect our team's reputation from being associated with someone who's got more rainbow flags than an Mardi Gras parade."<br/><br/>Cavallo, however, remains unimpressed and has continued to speak out against the alleged homophobia. "It's hard to swallow when I realised my own club was homophobic," he said in a statement that would make even the most stoic of souls crack a smile. And by "hard to swallow," we mean his teammates probably just got tired of him being all like, "Hey guys, can you pass the nachos?"<br/><br/>But what's really going on here is that Adelaide United is trying to cover up their own internal struggles with their team's Pride Cup participation. I mean, who needs a Pride cup when you've got a jersey that says "I'm with stupid" and points to your teammate's awkward dancing?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Josh Cavallo has been rocking the Pride flag like it's nobody's business, inspiring other players to come out as gay in the process. And by "rocking the Pride flag," we mean he probably just got tired of wearing his Adelaide United jersey and decided to trade it in for something a bit more... fabulous.<br/><br/>So there you have it, folks! The real story behind Josh Cavallo's alleged sidelining: a tale of homophobia, pride, and nachos. Stay classy, Adelaide United!<br/><br/>---<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the Adelaide United spokesperson has been seen sneaking into a local drag club under the pseudonym "Bubbles O'Malley." When asked for comment, they simply said, "I'm here to learn about the art of drag and not to judge, darling!"</p>
