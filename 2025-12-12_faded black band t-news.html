        <p>BREAKING: World's Rarest Ape Found Dead, But Not Before It Got a Mullet and Started a Punk Rock Band<br/><br/>In shocking news that will leave you speechless, the world's rarest ape, the Tapanuli orangutan, has been found dead in the forests of north Sumatra, Indonesia. But don't worry, it's not all doom and gloom - because before its untimely demise, this majestic creature had time to get a rad mullet haircut and start a punk rock band.<br/><br/>Sources close to the investigation reveal that the carcass, which was found semi-buried in mud and logs, showed signs of having been ripped apart by massive landslides caused by Cyclone Senyar. But we're pretty sure it's not a coincidence that this is happening on the same day as the World's Okayest Haircut Day.<br/><br/>Experts warn that fewer than 800 Tapanuli orangutans remain, and any loss would have a serious impact on the species. But let's be real, they've been doing just fine so far - I mean, who needs conservation when you can have a sick mullet?<br/><br/>"It was like something out of a bad music video," said Deckey Chandra, who stumbled upon the dead animal while working with a humanitarian team in the area. "I thought it was just a bunch of hair at first, but then I saw its adorable face and thought, 'Oh man, this guy is going to be a star!'"<br/><br/>Professor Erik Meijaard, managing director of Borneo Futures, added that he's extrapolated the destruction figure to 7,200 hectares in his preliminary observation - which means there must have been consequences for them... or something.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Panut Hadisiswoyo, founder of Orangutan Information Centre, is now considering renaming the Tapanuli orangutan to "Orangu-Ledo" in honor of its legendary mullet. We're not kidding; this dude had a hairdo that would put any 80s rockstar to shame.<br/><br/>When asked about the devastating impact on conservation efforts, Dr Ian Singleton, scientific director for the Sumatran Orangutan Conservation Programme, simply shrugged and said, "Well, at least it died with some great hair."<br/><br/>And Serge Wich, professor of primate biology at Liverpool John Moores University, quipped, "Yeah, these orangutans were always a little rebellious - I mean, who needs opposable thumbs when you can just shred on an air guitar?"<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates on this developing story - and remember to follow us on social media for the latest news on punk rock apes and mullets.</p>
