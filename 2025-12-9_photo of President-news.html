        <p>In a failed coup attempt, plotters in Benin were thwarted by the national mood (and President Patrice Talon's wife's displeased dog Fido), while Nigerian President Bola Tinubu responded with air strikes and Ecowas leaders scrambled to send troops, resulting in a chaotic yet hilarious scene.</p>

        <p>COUP SHENANIGANS: WHY BENIN'S REBEL SOLDIERS FAILED WHERE OTHERS SUCCEEDED (OR NOT)<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, plotters in Benin decided to stage a coup attempt, only to be met with swift and merciless defeat by the country's military. But don't worry, folks, it's not all doom and gloom – we've got the scoop on why this particular coup failed where others have succeeded (or not).<br/><br/>According to sources close to the situation, the would-be putschists misjudged the national mood and thought they could pull off a successful coup. But, as it turns out, the people of Benin were like, "Uh, no thanks." And by "people," I mean President Patrice Talon's wife's dog, Fido – he was not happy about the whole thing.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Nigeria's President Bola Tinubu decided to lend a helping hand (and some air strikes) to his eastern neighbor. He figured, why not? It's not like we have anything better to do... and by "better," I mean watching reruns of "The Great British Baking Show" on Netflix.<br/><br/>As the situation unfolded, Ecowas leaders sprang into action – or at least, they tried to. You see, they had learned a valuable lesson from their misadventures in Niger last year: when in doubt, send some troops and hope for the best. And by "troops," I mean Ghana's President John Mahama's personal security detail – they're always ready for action (or so he thinks).<br/><br/>But wait, it gets better! The plotters, who were still trying to make a break for it, stumbled upon a group of Nigerian warplanes doing barrel rolls in the skies above Cotonou. Talk about a scene from an action movie!<br/><br/>In related news, Les Démocrates, the main opposition party, is now threatening to sue the government for not letting them participate in the upcoming presidential election. Because, you know, that's exactly what you do when faced with a coup attempt – take out your lawyers and get ready for a long day of drama.<br/><br/>As for Lt Col Pascal Tigri, the coup leader on the run, we hear he's been spotted sipping margaritas at a beachside resort in Togo. Who knew he had such great taste?<br/><br/>All in all, it was just another exciting day in West Africa – where coups are always a possibility and the only constant is change (and possibly some air strikes).<br/><br/>UPDATE: Just in, Fido has been spotted wearing a tiny "I'm with Patrice" t-shirt. We can't confirm whether he's running for office or not.</p>
