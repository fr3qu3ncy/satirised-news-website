        <p>WHO'S PERFORMING, WHO WILL WIN, AND EVERYTHING ELSE YOU NEED TO KNOW ABOUT THE 2026 GRAMMY CEREMONY (BUT NOT REALLY)<br/><br/> Ah, the Grammy Awards - where music's biggest stars come together to celebrate their own greatness. And by "biggest," I mean Taylor Swift, who will inevitably win album of the year for her next album, which she'll release on the way to and from the ceremony.<br/><br/>This year, the Grammys are being held at a secret location, but we can reveal that it's actually just a big empty warehouse in LA with some cardboard cutouts of Kanye West. But don't worry, the show will still go on - or rather, won't really start until someone realizes they've left their car keys in the other room.<br/><br/>WHO'S GOING TO WIN ALBUM OF THE YEAR? (PROBABLY NOT WHO YOU THINK)<br/><br/>The front-runners for album of the year are Bad Bunny, Kendrick Lamar, and Lady Gaga. But let's be real, it's going to be Justin Bieber who wins again, because someone has to keep his ego inflated. In fact, we heard rumors that he's been practicing his acceptance speech in the mirror, and all he can say is "Wow, I'm just... wow."<br/><br/>WILL THERE BE JUSTICE FOR MILLI VANILLI?! (YES, BUT ONLY IF THEY'VE LEARNED THEIR LESSON)<br/><br/>Milli Vanilli are nominated for best audiobook, but only if they agree to perform a duet with Barry Manilow. It's the perfect opportunity for them to make amends and prove that their vocal talents go beyond just miming.<br/><br/>CAN OLIVIA DEAN WIN BEST NEW ARTIST? (YES, BUT ONLY IF SHE AGREES TO DO A COLLABORATION WITH DAVE KOZ)<br/><br/>Olivia Dean is a strong contender for best new artist, but only if she agrees to team up with smooth jazz sensation Dave Koz. Together, they'll create the perfect blend of pop and... whatever it is that Dave Koz does.<br/><br/>WHAT ABOUT THE OTHER BIG PRIZES? (WHO CARES, IT'S ALL JUST A DISTRACTION FROM THE REAL ISSUE: TAYLOR SWIFT)<br/><br/>Record of the year is a close competition between Sabrina Carpenter's Manchild and Lady Gaga's Abracadabra. But let's be real, it's going to be Taylor Swift who wins again with her song about cats.<br/><br/>AND FINALLY... (WHO WILL WIN THE MOST AWARDS? PROBABLY JUSTIN BIEBER)<br/><br/>Justin Bieber is the favorite to win the most awards this year, mainly because he's got a team of accountants who are experts at finding loopholes in the voting system.</p>
