        <p>BREAKING: NASA Astronauts Return to Earth, But Not Before Stopping for a Nando's<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, NASA astronauts Jonny Kim and his crewmates Sergey Ryzhikov and Alexey Zubritsky have landed back on Earth after a 245-day mission aboard the International Space Station (ISS). But what you might not know is that they made a pit stop for a quick Nando's lunch before touching down in Kazakhstan.<br/><br/>According to sources, Kim, who was heard saying "I'm starving!" over the comms system, ordered a spicy chicken combo with extra fries. His cosmonaut friends, meanwhile, opted for a more traditional Russian dish – beef stroganoff (with a side of caviar, naturally).<br/><br/>"I mean, you can't just come back to Earth without refueling, right?" said Kim in an interview with BBC News. "Besides, I've always wanted to try Nando's in space. It's out of this world!"<br/><br/>The crew's unscheduled break was not without incident, however. Zubritsky accidentally spilled his drink on the ISS's control panel, causing a brief malfunction that threatened to derail their mission.<br/><br/>"We were like, 'Oh no, we're going to have to delay our landing!' But then Kim just laughed and said, 'Don't worry, Sergey, it's just a minor glitch... or should I say, a galaxy of problems?'" quipped Ryzhikov.<br/><br/>As the astronauts settled back into their seats, they were treated to an impromptu performance by none other than Justin Bieber. The pop star appeared on the ISS's screens via satellite, singing his hit single "Sorry" in a hastily arranged concert for the returning space travelers.<br/><br/>"I was like, 'Justin Bieber? Who's that?' But then I heard him sing and thought, 'Wow, he's actually pretty good!'" said Kim.<br/><br/>The crew members were also surprised to find that they had inadvertently brought back some alien artifacts from their time in space. "We found this weird rock thingy on the ISS," said Zubritsky. "I think it might be a piece of moon cheese or something."<br/><br/>And, as for what's next for these intergalactic heroes? "Well, we're thinking of starting a podcast where we review Nando's restaurants across the globe," said Kim.<br/><br/>"That sounds like a real treat... or should I say, a galactic experience?" chuckled Ryzhikov.<br/><br/>In related news, NASA has announced plans to launch a new space station – dubbed the "Nando's Express" – which will feature an onboard fast food joint serving only spicy chicken and fries. It's set to launch in 2025 and will be staffed by none other than Justin Bieber himself.<br/><br/>Stay tuned for more updates from the world of space travel, folks!</p>
