        <p>THE MOST AMAZING, UNBELIEVABLE, AND RIDICULOUS NEWS STORY EVER!<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, the Catholic Church in Spain has finally admitted that they've been naughty and agreed to pay compensation to all the people they've molested over the years. It's like a giant game of "I'm Sorry" for everyone who's ever had to deal with a creepy priest or nun trying to get their jollies off.<br/><br/>The agreement, signed in front of a crowd of people who were probably thinking, "What's going on? Is this some kind of joke?", promises that the Church will finally take responsibility for their decades-long cover-up and pay out cash to all the victims. And by "cash", we mean a small token amount that's barely enough to buy a decent glass of wine.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Vatican, Pope Francis was overheard saying, "I'm so sorry about this whole thing. Can someone please pass the nachos?" When asked for comment, he added, "And can you also pass the beer? I've got a long night ahead of me trying to figure out how to make this all work."<br/><br/>Justice Minister Félix Bolaños was on hand to sign the agreement, and when asked if he had any words for the victims, he said, "Tell them I'm sorry. Tell them I'm really, really sorry. Oh wait, I think I just got a text from my wife reminding me to pick up milk on the way home."<br/><br/>The deal also includes a clause that requires the Church to create a new agency to handle all the claims and then send them back to the ombudsman's office for further review. It's like trying to solve a Rubik's Cube while being attacked by a swarm of bees.<br/><br/>As one victim said, "I'm just happy they're finally taking responsibility for their actions. But honestly, it would have been better if they'd just sent us all a nice bottle of wine and a bouquet of flowers."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Pope Francis has announced plans to hold a special Mass in honor of the victims, during which he'll be serving free absolution to anyone who's ever committed a sin. It's like a giant game of "Get Out of Jail Free" for everyone.<br/><br/>And in other news, it's been reported that the Church is planning to replace all their priests with clowns. Because what could possibly go wrong with that?</p>
