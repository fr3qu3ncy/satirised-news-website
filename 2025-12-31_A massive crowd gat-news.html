        <p>BREAKING: MILLIONS MOURN DHAKA'S FAVOURITE GRANNY<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, millions of people have gathered in Dhaka to pay their final respects to Khaleda Zia, the 80-year-old granny who died on Tuesday. But it's not just any ordinary funeral - we're talking massive crowds, thousands of police officers, and even a cameo appearance by a Bollywood dancer.<br/><br/>As the motorcade carrying Zia's body drove through the streets, people held out their hands in prayer and waved tiny flags featuring her face. It was like a giant game of "Simon Says" except instead of saying "touch your toes," they were all saying "hug your granny." And let me tell you, it was a real hugg-a-palooza.<br/><br/>But amidst the sea of mourners, there were some notable absences. I mean, where was Kim Kardashian? Where was Elon Musk? Heck, even Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson was nowhere to be found. It's like they all thought Zia's funeral would be, you know, boring or something.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, India's External Affairs Minister S Jaishankar showed up, looking all sorts of dignified in his suit and tie. I'm pretty sure he was there for the free snacks, though - rumor has it that the Bangladeshi government laid out a spread of samosas and biryani fit for a queen.<br/><br/>And speaking of queens, Khaleda Zia's son Tarique Rahman made an appearance, looking all brooding and "I'm-a-male-version-of-Kim-Kardashian" in his suit. I mean, who needs therapy when you can just grow a scruffy beard and look sad?<br/><br/>As for the state funeral itself? Let's just say it was a real spectacle. There were speeches, there were prayers, and even a few people doing the cha cha slide on top of the hearse (don't ask). It was like a giant Bangladeshi dance party, and everyone was invited... except for the guy who accidentally set off the fire alarm.<br/><br/>All joking aside, Khaleda Zia was a true leader and a trailblazer in her own right. She paved the way for future generations of women leaders (or at least inspired them to take up politics so they could attend funerals in style).<br/><br/>So as we say goodbye to this incredible granny-turned-stateswoman, let's remember her legacy: she brought people together, even if it was just to dance on top of a hearse.<br/><br/>UPDATE: We've just received word that the Bangladeshi government is planning a sequel funeral for Khaleda Zia, but this time with more Bollywood dancers and fewer fire alarms. Stay tuned!</p>
