        <p>BREAKING NEWS<br/><br/>NAMIBIA LOSES BID TO OVERTURN BAN ON RHINO HORN TRADE... BUT NOT BEFORE THEY TRIED TO SELL THEIR STOCKPILE TO THE WORLDS LARGEST PRODUCER OF CANNOLI<br/><br/>8 hours ago<br/><br/>ShareSave Navin Singh Khadka, BBC's resident comedian and wildlife correspondent, reports from the secret underground bunker where the real news happens.<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, Namibia has been rejected by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (Cites) for their proposal to lift the ban on black and white rhino horns. But little do they know, we've got the inside scoop that they were actually trying to sell their massive stockpile to Italy... yes, you read that right, ITALY! It turns out they wanted to trade their rhino horn for a year's supply of cannoli.<br/><br/>According to sources close to the Italian Ministry of Cakes and Pastries (yes, that's a real thing!), Namibia's proposal was met with laughter, tears, and a stern warning from Italian authorities: "Listen, amigos, we've got our priorities straight. We're not trading in rhino horns for cannoli just yet."<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the actual news is this: Namibia has built up large stockpiles of rhino horn after pioneering the practice of cutting them off to deter poachers... but it seems they're more interested in making a quick buck than actually helping the rhinos.<br/><br/>WHAT THE HECK IS GOING ON HERE?<br/><br/>Experts say that by dehorning their rhinos, Namibia and other southern African countries have created an incentive for poachers to kill even more rhinos. Think about it: if there's no horn on a rhino, what's the point of killing it? EXACTLY!<br/><br/>In related news, we've just learned that South Africa has amassed a whopping 4.6 tonnes of black rhino horns and 15.75 tonnes of white rhino horns (which is roughly equivalent to the weight of a small island). And Kenya, being the good guys they are, destroy their stockpiles rather than trying to sell them to unsuspecting nations.<br/><br/>SO WHAT'S NEXT?<br/><br/>Well, it looks like Namibia's rhino horn trade proposals have been shot down... again. But we're not done yet! Stay tuned for more updates from our comedy news desk as we follow this saga of bureaucratic nonsense and pastry-fueled shenanigans.<br/><br/>FACT CHECKER TIME!<br/><br/>Here are some actual facts to keep you grounded in reality:<br/><br/>* Black rhinos are listed as critically endangered species.<br/>* Southern white rhinos are not quite as threatened, but still need our help (only 15.75 tonnes of horns left!).<br/>* Rhino horn is highly prized in traditional Asian medicine... and by pastry chefs worldwide.<br/><br/>Stay informed, stay entertained, and remember: if you ever find yourself in a situation where someone tries to sell you rhino horn for cannoli, RUN.</p>
