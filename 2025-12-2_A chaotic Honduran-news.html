    <div class="article">
        <p>**BREAKING: Honduran Presidential Election Descends into Chaos**<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, right-wing candidate Nasry Asfura has been declared the winner of the Honduran presidential election by a whisker – just 515 votes ahead of his nearest challenger, Salvador Nasralla. Yes, you read that correctly: 515 votes is roughly equivalent to the number of times Dwayne "The Rock" Johnson's Instagram account gets liked per hour.<br/><br/>As tensions rise in the capital city of Tegucigalpa, officials have been forced to abandon their count due to a cyber attack, leaving many wondering if they'll ever find out who won. In fact, the only thing that's more confusing than the vote count is trying to figure out what Elmo had for breakfast.<br/><br/>But it's not all doom and gloom! US President Donald Trump has weighed in on the situation, tweeting "Fake news, folks! The count was stopped because they're trying to change the results. Sad!" Meanwhile, Elon Musk has tweeted a series of cryptic messages about the election, including one that read simply "Tinfoil hats at the ready!"<br/><br/>As for the candidates themselves, Asfura is over the moon with excitement, while Nasralla has taken to Instagram to share his disappointment in a series of heartfelt selfies. When asked for comment, Asfura's team was unavailable due to a scheduling conflict – they were all busy eating tacos.<br/><br/>In related news, the country's electoral commission has announced that it will be conducting an emergency investigation into claims that a group of mischievous monkeys had been tampering with ballots in the western district of Tegucigalpa. When asked for comment, the lead investigator simply shrugged and said "Who knows, maybe they're just trying to get in on the action."<br/><br/>As tensions continue to rise, the people of Honduras are advised to remain calm – unless you're a fan of The Rock, in which case, go ahead and freak out.<br/><br/>**UPDATE:** Just in, sources close to the election commission have revealed that they've found a hidden stash of votes buried deep beneath the capital's famous "Mercado del Indio" market. When asked about the discovery, officials simply shrugged and said "Oh, those? Those were just some extra ballots from last week's bake sale."</p>
