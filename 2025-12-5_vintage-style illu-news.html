        <h2>"TRUMP'S PEACE DEAL: Where Coal Miners Are the Key to Lasting Peace...or Something?"</h2>
    </div>

    <div class="summery">
        <p>Donald Trump hosted a "historic" peace deal signing between DR Congo and Rwanda, which somehow included sending coal miners to extract mineral resources while promising to share the profits and making everyone involved look suspiciously enthusiastic.</p>

    <div class="article">
        <p>BREAKING: Trump's Peace Deal is a Total Disaster...in a Good Way?<br/><br/>In a shocking turn of events, US President Donald Trump hosted a peace deal signing ceremony between the leaders of DR Congo and Rwanda at the newly-renamed Donald J Trump Institute of Peace. Because what's more peaceful than renaming an institute after a guy who loves tweeting, right?<br/><br/>As part of the "historic" deal, Trump promised to send "some of our biggest and greatest companies" (read: coal miners) to the region to extract all the mineral resources they can find. And by "greatest companies," we mean companies that will make America great again...by making a lot of money off DR Congo's vast mineral reserves.<br/><br/>But wait, there's more! The peace deal also includes provisions for Rwanda and DR Congo to share their profits from the mineral extraction, because sharing is caring...and who doesn't love a good business partnership?<br/><br/>At the ceremony, Trump praised both leaders for being "even-handed" (read: not completely crazy), and Rwandan President Paul Kagame called Trump's approach "pragmatic." Because what's more pragmatic than exploiting natural resources in a conflict zone?<br/><br/>Meanwhile, DR Congo's President Felix Tshisekedi expressed his "deep gratitude and clear hope" that the deal will lead to lasting peace...or at least until they get their hands on some of that sweet, sweet mineral revenue.<br/><br/>But not everyone is thrilled about the deal. A researcher from the Institute for Security Studies think-tank (because we need more acronyms) pointed out that there's still a lot of fighting going on in eastern DR Congo, and the M23 rebels are still in control of several key cities. But hey, who needs actual peace when you can have a signed piece of paper?<br/><br/>And if you're wondering what happened to the Qatar-brokered talks (remember those?), well, let's just say they were "parallel" to this whole thing...in more ways than one.<br/><br/>In related news, Donald Trump's hair looked fabulous at the ceremony. Just saying.<br/><br/>UPDATE: The BBC has confirmed that the US Secretary of State is actually Marco Rubio, not Donald Trump. Who knew?</p>
