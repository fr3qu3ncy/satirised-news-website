        <p>BREAKING: Former Nigerian Justice Minister Abubakar Malami's Wife Caught Dancing the Macarena in Court, Husband Granted Bail<br/><br/>In a bizarre turn of events, Nigeria's former justice minister Abubakar Malami was granted bail yesterday, along with his wife and son, who are facing money laundering charges. But what made this news story truly unforgettable was when Malami's wife, Nana Hadiza, busted out some killer dance moves in the courtroom.<br/><br/>As the judge was pronouncing the bail conditions, Mrs. Malami suddenly stood up and started dancing the Macarena to a stunned courtroom audience. Her husband, Abubakar, looked on in amusement as his wife got down to business, waving her arms and shimmying her shoulders like nobody's business.<br/><br/>The courtroom erupted into cheers and applause as Mrs. Malami danced her way through the bail conditions, which included providing two guarantors who own property in Abuja and surrendering their travel documents to the court. It was clear that she had practiced her routine in front of a mirror, because her dance moves were so smooth they could have put Beyoncé to shame.<br/><br/>But things took an even stranger turn when Elton John suddenly appeared out of nowhere, playing a rendition of "Rocket Man" on his piano while Mrs. Malami danced the Macarena. It was unclear who had arranged this impromptu performance, but it's clear that someone in that courtroom was ready for their close-up.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, Abubakar Malami looked like he was enjoying the show, nodding his head and tapping his foot along with the music. His son, however, seemed a bit embarrassed by the whole thing, trying to hide behind his father as Mrs. Malami danced her way out of court.<br/><br/>As for the charges against them? Don't worry about that – they'll deal with those later. Right now, everyone's just too busy dancing the Macarena and singing along to Elton John classics.<br/><br/>Corrections:<br/><br/>* The story has been changed to include Elton John's surprise appearance in the courtroom.<br/>* Mrs. Malami's dance moves have been upgraded from "killer" to "smooth like Beyoncé".<br/>* Abubakar Malami is now enjoying himself, nodding his head and tapping his foot along with the music.<br/><br/>Side Bar:<br/><br/>* If you're wondering why Elton John was in Nigeria in the first place, let's just say he's been working on a new musical – "The Lion King of Corruption".<br/>* We're still waiting to hear from Abubakar Malami about whether or not he'll be performing any dance routines at his upcoming trial.<br/><br/>Additional Reporting:<br/><br/>* It turns out that Mrs. Malami has been secretly training for the Macarena in her spare time, with plans to compete in the World Dance Championship next year.<br/>* When asked for comment, Elton John simply said, "I'm here to bring a little bit of magic to this courtroom, and maybe even inspire some new dance moves."<br/><br/>Disclaimer:<br/><br/>* The BBC is not responsible for any damage caused by people attempting to bust out the Macarena in public places. Please dance responsibly.<br/><br/>Update:<br/><br/>* We've just received word that Abubakar Malami's wife has been asked to perform at the next World Dance Championship – will she be able to live up to her courtroom debut?</p>
